      "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of\n",
      "_The Adventures of Tom Sawyer;_ but that ain't no matter. That book\n",
      "was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was\n",
      "things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is\n",
      "nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it\n",
      "was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt\n",
      "Polly, she is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in\n",
      "that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I\n",
      "said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at\n",
      "interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old\n",
      "thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had\n",
      "to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to\n",
      "eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and\n",
      "grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really\n",
      "anything the matter with them--that is, nothing only everything was\n",
      "cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things\n",
      "get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go\n",
      "better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time;\n",
      "so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock\n",
      "in dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\n",
      "wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she\n",
      "was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to\n",
      "anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for\n",
      "doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of\n",
      "course that was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "\"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry\"; and \"Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight\"; and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, \"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try\n",
      "to behave?\" Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I\n",
      "wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I\n",
      "wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't\n",
      "particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she\n",
      "wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go\n",
      "to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where\n",
      "she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never\n",
      "said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the\n",
      "good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go\n",
      "around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I\n",
      "didn't think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she\n",
      "reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable\n",
      "sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      "By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so\n",
      "lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was\n",
      "trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it\n",
      "was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the\n",
      "woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to\n",
      "tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself\n",
      "understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about\n",
      "that way every night grieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did\n",
      "wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my\n",
      "shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I\n",
      "could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me\n",
      "that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I\n",
      "was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned\n",
      "around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and\n",
      "then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches\n",
      "away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a\n",
      "horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door,\n",

      "scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a\n",
      "root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's\n",
      "big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see\n",
      "him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and\n",

      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so\n",
      "close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but\n",
      "I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      "Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the\n",

      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",

      "come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the\n",
      "inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was\n",
      "going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven\n",
      "minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in\n",
      "eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a\n",
      "minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then\n",

      "hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he\n",
      "didn't wake. Afterward Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him\n",
      "in a trance, and rode him all over the state, and then set him under\n",

      "and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to\n",
      "death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud\n",
      "about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.\n",
      "Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more\n",
      "looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would\n",
      "stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was\n",
      "a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the\n",
      "kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all\n",
      "about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm! What you know\n",
      "'bout witches?\" and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back\n",
      "seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a\n",
      "string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own\n",
      "hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches\n",
      "whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never\n",
      "told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around\n",
      "there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that\n",

      "where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling\n",
      "ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile\n",
      "broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Joe\n",
      "Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the\n",

      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon\n",
      "ducked under a wall where you wouldn't 'a' noticed that there was a\n",
      "hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all\n",
      "damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his\n",

      "to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if\n",
      "he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to\n",
      "the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have\n",
      "his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name\n",
      "blotted off the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang,\n",
      "but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head. He said some of it, but the rest was out of\n",

      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hain't he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been\n",
      "seen in these parts for a year or more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think\n",
      "of anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most\n",
      "ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered\n",
      "them Miss Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",

      "\"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,\"\n",
      "says Tom Sawyer. \"We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Must we always kill the people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring\n",
      "to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ransomed? What's that?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the\n",
      "books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,\n",
      "and get things all muddled up?\"\n",

      "it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Now, that's something _like._ That'll answer. Why couldn't you said\n",

      "bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always\n",
      "trying to get loose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard\n",
      "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody's got to set up all night\n",
      "and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that's\n",
      "foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\n",
      "they get here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it ain't in the books so--that's why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you\n",
      "want to do things regular, or don't you?--that's the idea. Don't you\n",
      "reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct\n",
      "thing to do? Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything? Not by a good\n",
      "deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say, do\n",
      "we kill the women, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill\n",
      "the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You\n",
      "fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;\n",
      "and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home\n",
      "any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.\n",
      "Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and\n",

      "day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I\n",

      "didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in\n",
      "the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He was laying over by the\n",
      "corner. By and by he raised up part way and listened, with his head to\n",

      "\n",
      "By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he\n",

      "cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned short and dodged\n",
      "under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my\n",

      "a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give\n",

      "luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come\n",
      "along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and\n",

      "closest to the shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along\n",
      "comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook\n",

      "begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak\n",
      "over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and\n",
      "slipped off towards where I had run across that camp-fire, stopping\n",
      "every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I\n",
      "couldn't seem to find the place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched\n",
      "a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I went for it, cautious and\n",
      "slow. By and by I was close enough to have a look, and there laid a\n",
      "man on the ground. It most give me the fantods.  He had a blanket\n",

      "in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I\n",
      "said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the\n",
      "traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the\n",
      "island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he\n",
      "said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want\n",
      "the things to get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on\n",
      "one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat\n",
      "and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in\n",
      "there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.\n",
      "Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the\n",
      "birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained\n",
      "like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of\n",
      "these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all\n",
      "blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so\n",
      "thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby;\n",
      "and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and\n",
      "turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of\n",
      "a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms\n",
      "as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest\n",
      "and blackest--_fst!_ it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a\n",
      "little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the\n",
      "storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as\n",
      "sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an\n",
      "awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky\n",
      "towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels\n",

      "The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\n",
      "last it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on\n",
      "the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side\n",
      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the\n",
      "same old distance across--a half a mile--because the Missouri shore\n",
      "was just a wall of high bluffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe. It was mighty\n",
      "cool and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.\n",

      "hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on\n",
      "every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such\n",
      "things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got\n",
      "so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up\n",
      "and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and\n",
      "turtles--they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was\n",
      "in was full of them. We could 'a' had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber-raft--nice pine\n",
      "planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot\n",
      "long, and the top stood above water six or seven inches--a solid,\n",
      "level floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes,\n",
      "but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a\n",
      "two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboard--clumb in at an up-stairs window. But it was too dark to see\n",
      "yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and\n",
      "there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying\n",
      "on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, you!\"\n",
      "\n",

      "I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan'\n",
      "look at his face--it's too gashly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky-bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      "There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's\n",
      "clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.\n",
      "There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that,\n",
      "too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag\n",
      "stopper for a baby to suck. We would 'a' took the bottle, but it was\n",
      "broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the\n",
      "hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them\n",
      "that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned\n",
      "the people left in a hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most\n",
      "of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of\n",
      "tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and\n",
      "a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins\n",

      "pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up\n",
      "with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger\n",
      "a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted\n",
      "down most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the\n",

      "said it would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie\n",
      "them around his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid\n",
      "out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I\n",
      "warn't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could\n",
      "help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his\n",

      "said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we\n",
      "hadn't got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon\n",
      "over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a\n",
      "snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,\n",
      "though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your\n",
      "left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body\n",
      "can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in\n",

      "spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may\n",
      "say; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin,\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\n",
      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as\n",
      "big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would 'a' flung\n",
      "us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear\n",
      "around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a\n",
      "round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the\n",
      "hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a\n",
      "long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a\n",
      "fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he\n",
      "hadn't ever seen a bigger one. He would 'a' been worth a good deal\n",
      "over at the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound\n",

      "Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get\n",

      "and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I\n",
      "must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      "That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.\n",
      "Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on\n",
      "the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look\n",
      "in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim\n",
      "said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practised\n",
      "around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do\n",
      "pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he\n",

      "till this thing blows over a little, for people thinks now that he\n",
      "killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it,\n",
      "and then he'd get Huck's money without having to bother a long time\n",
      "with a lawsuit. People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh,\n",
      "he's sly, I reckon. If he don't come back for a year he'll be all\n",
      "right. You can't prove anything on him, you know; everything will be\n",

      "around every day for people to pick up? Some folks think the nigger\n",
      "ain't far from here. I'm one of them--but I hain't talked it around. A\n",
      "few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in\n",
      "the log shanty, and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to\n",
      "that island over yonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't anybody\n",
      "live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn't say any more, but\n",
      "I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over\n",
      "there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that, so I\n",
      "says to myself, like as not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway,\n",

      "\n",

      "it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When the woman\n",
      "stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty curious\n",
      "and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and let on to\n",
      "be interested--and I was, too--and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother could get\n",
      "it. Is your husband going over there to-night?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of, to get a\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I didn't think of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn't feel a bit\n",

      "\"What did you say your name was, honey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"M--Mary Williams.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I\n",
      "didn't look up--seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt sort of\n",
      "cornered, and was afeard maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the\n",
      "woman would say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier\n",
      "I was. But now she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah's my first name. Some\n",

      "\n",

      "I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I\n",
      "couldn't look up yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor\n",
      "they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\n",
      "place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was\n",
      "right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in\n",
      "the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy\n",
      "to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no\n",
      "peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said\n",
      "she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day\n",
      "or two ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she\n",
      "watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but she\n",
      "missed him wide, and said, \"Ouch!\" it hurt her arm so. Then she told\n",
      "me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old\n",
      "man got back, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the\n",
      "first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd 'a' stayed\n",
      "where he was he'd 'a' been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was\n",
      "first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and\n",
      "got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of\n",
      "yarn which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and\n",
      "she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her\n",
      "husband's matters. But she broke off to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your lap,\n",
      "handy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\n",
      "my legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a\n",
      "minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\n",
      "and very pleasant, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come, now, what's your real name?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wh-hat, mum?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?--or what is it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't know hardly what to do. But\n",
      "I says:\n",

      "way here, I'll--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you won't. Set down and stay where you are. I ain't going to hurt\n",
      "you, and I ain't going to tell on you, nuther. You just tell me your\n",
      "secret, and trust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll help you.\n",
      "So'll my old man if you want him to. You see, you're a runaway\n",
      "'prentice, that's all. It ain't anything. There ain't no harm in it.\n",
      "You've been treated bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Bless you,\n",
      "child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me all about it now, that's a good\n",
      "boy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it any longer, and I\n",
      "would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she\n",
      "mustn't go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother\n",
      "was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the\n",
      "country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I\n",
      "couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days,\n",
      "and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes\n",
      "and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.\n",
      "I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread\n",
      "and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had\n",
      "a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of\n",
      "me, and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's\n",
      "ten mile further up the river. Who told you this was Goshen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to\n",
      "turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads\n",
      "forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to\n",
      "Goshen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't no matter now. I got\n",
      "to be moving along. I'll fetch Goshen before daylight.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat. You might want it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she put me up a snack, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of her gets up first? Answer\n",
      "up prompt now--don't stop to study over it. Which end gets up first?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The whole fifteen, mum.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I reckon you _have_ lived in the country. I thought maybe you\n",
      "was trying to hocus me again. What's your real name, now?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"George Peters, mum.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Elexander when I catch you. And don't go about women in that old\n",
      "calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men, maybe.\n",
      "Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle don't hold the\n",
      "thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the needle still and\n",
      "poke the thread at it; that's the way a woman most always does, but a\n",
      "man always does t'other way. And when you throw at a rat or anything,\n",
      "hitch yourself up a-tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as\n",
      "awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throw\n",
      "stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot there for it to\n",
      "turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with your arm out\n",
      "to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch\n",
      "anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clap them\n",
      "together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead. Why, I\n",
      "spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and I\n",
      "contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to\n",
      "your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you\n",
      "get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and\n",
      "I'll do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the\n",
      "way, and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river\n",
      "road's a rocky one, and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get\n",
      "to Goshen, I reckon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\n",
      "and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.\n",
      "I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to\n",
      "make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the\n",
      "sun-bonnet, for I didn't want no blinders on then. When I was about\n",
      "the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and listens;\n",
      "the sound come faint over the water but clear--eleven. When I struck\n",
      "the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most\n",
      "winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to\n",
      "be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a\n",
      "half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the\n",
      "timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound\n",
      "asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't a minute to lose. They're\n",
      "after us!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he\n",
      "worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By\n",
      "that time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was\n",
      "ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put\n",
      "out the camp-fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a\n",
      "candle outside after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\n",
      "but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and\n",
      "shadows ain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped\n",
      "along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still--never\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It must 'a' been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island\n",
      "at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to\n",
      "come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the\n",
      "Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever\n",
      "thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to\n",
      "eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.\n",
      "It warn't good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp-fire I\n",
      "built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed\n",
      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't\n",
      "no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in\n",
      "a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches\n",
      "with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like\n",
      "there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sand-bar\n",
      "that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the\n",
      "Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that\n",
      "place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there\n",
      "all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri\n",
      "shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I\n",
      "told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim\n",
      "said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she\n",
      "wouldn't set down and watch a camp-fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.\n",
      "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?\n",
      "Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to\n",
      "start, and he believed they must 'a' gone up-town to get a dog and so\n",
      "they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead\n",
      "sixteen or seventeen mile below the village--no, indeedy, we would be\n",
      "in that same old town again. So I said I didn't care what was the\n",
      "reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in\n",
      "sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a\n",
      "snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the\n",
      "things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or\n",
      "more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the\n",
      "traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the\n",
      "wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a\n",
      "frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire\n",
      "on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being\n",
      "seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others\n",
      "might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked\n",
      "stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the\n",
      "lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from\n",
      "getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats\n",
      "unless we see we was in what they call a \"crossing\"; for the river was\n",
      "pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so\n",
      "up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but hunted easy water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs\n",
      "looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud,\n",
      "and it warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low\n",
      "chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing\n",
      "ever happened to us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit\n",
      "up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty\n",
      "thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that\n",
      "wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There\n",
      "warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore toward ten o'clock at some\n",
      "little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon\n",
      "or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't\n",
      "roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a\n",
      "chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself\n",
      "you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever\n",
      "forgot. I never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but\n",
      "that is what he used to say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into corn-fields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things\n",
      "of that kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if\n",
      "you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it\n",
      "warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would\n",
      "do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was\n",
      "partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three\n",
      "things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he\n",
      "reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it\n",
      "over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up\n",
      "our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the\n",
      "mushmelons, or what. But toward daylight we got it all settled\n",
      "satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We\n",
      "warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.\n",
      "I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever\n",
      "good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight,\n",
      "with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a\n",
      "solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of\n",
      "itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight\n",
      "river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I,\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo_, Jim, looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed\n",
      "herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The\n",
      "lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of\n",
      "her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy\n",
      "clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat\n",
      "hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so\n",
      "mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would 'a' felt when\n",
      "I seen that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle\n",
      "of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little,\n",
      "and see what there was there. So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Le's land on her, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\n",

      "\n",

      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" Jim\n",

      "_they_ don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they\n",
      "want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we\n",
      "give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this\n",
      "thing? Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's\n",

      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any\n",
      "more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning\n",
      "showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard\n",

      "so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in\n",
      "the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      "This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",

      "\"But I don't _want_ him killed, and I've got my reasons for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard! I'll never forgit you\n",

      "\n",
      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a\n",
      "nail and started toward where I was, there in the dark, and motioned\n",
      "Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the\n",
      "boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from\n",
      "getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper\n",

      "\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in\n",

      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been\n",
      "having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much\n",
      "difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't 'a' treed me\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gather up whatever\n",

      "more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the\n",

      "_got_ to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went\n",
      "a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was,\n",

      "said he didn't believe he could go any farther--so scared he hadn't\n",
      "hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left\n",
      "on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck\n",
      "for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\n",
      "forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the\n",
      "edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the\n",
      "cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely\n",

      "gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!\" He flung a bag of\n",
      "something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was\n",

      "\n",
      "We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly\n",
      "even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip\n",
      "of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we\n",
      "was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up,\n",
      "every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\n",
      "show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed\n",
      "by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\n",
      "understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner\n",
      "was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the\n",
      "first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't had\n",
      "time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\n",
      "murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain't no\n",
      "telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how\n",

      "\n",
      "But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again,\n",
      "and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light\n",
      "showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river,\n",
      "watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the\n",
      "rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\n",
      "and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we\n",
      "made for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We\n",
      "seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would\n",
      "go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had\n",
      "stole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and\n",
      "I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had\n",
      "gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my\n",
      "oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or  four\n",
      "more showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the\n",
      "shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it\n",
      "was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I\n",
      "skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and\n",
      "by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head\n",
      "down between his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little\n",
      "shoves, and begun to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was\n",
      "only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\n",

      "We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind\n",
      "a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She\n",
      "had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as\n",
      "thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and\n",
      "an open camp-fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.\n",
      "There was a power of style about her. It _amounted_ to something being\n",
      "a raftsman on such a craft as that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and\n",
      "got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\n",
      "both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We\n",
      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got\n",
      "to it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't\n",
      "but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them\n",
      "lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if\n",
      "the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said\n",
      "maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming\n",
      "into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the\n",
      "question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light\n",
      "showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a\n",
      "trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know\n",
      "how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a\n",
      "smoke on it and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\n",
      "not pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,\n",
      "because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\n",
      "he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every\n",
      "little while he jumps up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dah she is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning-bugs; so he set\n",
      "down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him\n",
      "all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can\n",
      "tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\n",
      "because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and\n",
      "who was to blame for it? Why, _me_. I couldn't get that out of my\n",
      "conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't\n",
      "rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to\n",
      "me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and\n",
      "it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out\n",
      "to myself that _I_ warn't to blame, because _I_ didn't run Jim off\n",
      "from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says,\n",
      "every time, \"But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you\n",
      "could 'a' paddled ashore and told somebody.\" That was so--I couldn't\n",
      "get around that no way. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to\n",
      "me, \"What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her\n",
      "nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word?\n",
      "What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so\n",
      "mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you\n",
      "your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how.\n",
      "_That's_ what she done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I\n",
      "fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was\n",
      "fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.\n",
      "Every time he danced around and says, \"Dah's Cairo!\" it went through\n",
      "me like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die\n",
      "of miserableness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was\n",
      "saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he\n",
      "would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he\n",
      "got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to\n",
      "where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two\n",
      "children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an\n",
      "Ab'litionist to go and steal them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk\n",
      "such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in\n",
      "him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the\n",
      "old saying, \"Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.\" Thinks I,\n",
      "this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I\n",
      "had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and\n",
      "saying he would steal his children--children that belonged to a man I\n",
      "didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My\n",
      "conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I\n",
      "says to it, \"Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore\n",
      "at the first light and tell.\" I felt easy and happy and light as a\n",
      "feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out\n",
      "sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one\n",
      "showed. Jim sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom\n",
      "for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on\n",

      "\n",
      "I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says\n",

      "slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I\n",
      "started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\n",

      "off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and\n",
      "thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was\n",
      "going to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a\n",
      "bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking\n",
      "like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a\n",
      "sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open\n",
      "furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and\n",
      "guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling\n",
      "of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of\n",

      "minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\n",

      "was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if\n",

      "Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow\n",
      "Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first\n",
      "aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he\n",
      "warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was\n",
      "very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign\n",
      "of red in it anywheres; he was clean-shaved every morning all over his\n",
      "thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind\n",
      "of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest\n",
      "kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking\n",
      "out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his\n",
      "hair was gray and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was\n",
      "long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a\n",
      "full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your\n",
      "eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass\n",
      "buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.\n",
      "There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever\n",
      "loud. He was as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know,\n",
      "and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to\n",
      "see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the\n",
      "lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to\n",
      "climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He\n",
      "didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was\n",
      "always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around,\n",
      "too; he was sunshine most always--I mean he made it seem like good\n",
      "weather. When he turned into a cloud-bank it was awful dark for half a\n",

      "up out of their chairs and give them good day, and didn't set down\n",
      "again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard\n",
      "where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to\n",
      "him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was\n",
      "mixed, and then they bowed and said, \"Our duty to you, sir, and\n",

      "you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful\n",
      "of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple-brandy in the\n",

      "junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the\n",
      "woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly\n",
      "kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It was a\n",
      "handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\n",

      "heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from\n",
      "his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we\n",
      "was hid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run.\n",
      "The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the\n",

      "see. We never stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman's\n",
      "eyes blazed a minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face\n",
      "sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:\n",

      "another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\n",
      "then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\n",
      "_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I should _reckon!_ It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along\n",

      "there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid\n",
      "lonesomeness. Next you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and\n",
      "maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they're most always doing it on\n",
      "a raft; you'd see the ax flash and come down--you don't hear nothing;\n",
      "you see that ax go up again, and by the time it's above the man's head\n",
      "then you hear the _k'chunk!_--it had took all that time to come over\n",
      "the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to\n",
      "the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things\n",
      "that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over\n",
      "them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and\n",
      "cussing and laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of\n",
      "them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that\n",
      "way in the air. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'\"\n",

      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks\n",
      "made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go\n",
      "much on clothes, nohow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and\n",
      "maybe a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on\n",
      "the water you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know;\n",
      "and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of\n",
      "them crafts. It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there,\n",
      "all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up\n",
      "at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just\n",
      "happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I\n",
      "judged it would have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the\n",
      "moon could 'a' _laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I\n",
      "didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as\n",
      "many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that\n",
      "fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled\n",
      "and was hove out of the nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in\n",
      "the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up\n",
      "out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look\n",
      "awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink\n",
      "out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by\n",
      "and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and\n",
      "joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for\n",
      "you couldn't tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",
      "three hours the shores was black--no more sparks in the cabin windows.\n",
      "These sparks was our clock--the first one that showed again meant\n",

      "One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to\n",
      "the main shore--it was only two hundred yards--and paddled about a\n",

      "some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath\n",
      "crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as\n",
      "tight as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever\n",
      "anybody was after anybody I judged it was _me_--or maybe Jim. I was\n",
      "about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to\n",
      "me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives--said they\n",
      "hadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased for it--said there was\n",
      "men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horses yet; you've got\n",

      "throw the dogs off the scent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead,\n",
      "and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away\n",
      "off, shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but\n",
      "couldn't see them; they seemed to stop and fool around awhile; then,\n",
      "as we got further and further away all the time, we couldn't hardly\n",
      "hear them at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us\n",
      "and struck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the\n",

      "too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to\n",
      "comfort _him._ But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead\n",
      "and done with it all could do him any good; though he said it often\n",

      "and standing up till he told us we might set down. This done him heaps\n",
      "of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of\n",
      "soured on him, and didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was\n",
      "going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the\n",
      "duke's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a\n",
      "good deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the\n",

      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn't\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other\n",

      "ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans\n",
      "on it. Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard\n",
      "corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under\n",
      "the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was\n",
      "only four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next\n",
      "day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always\n",

      "tired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign,\" as they\n",
      "called it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a\n",
      "lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said,\n",

      "satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\n",
      "most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\n",
      "time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\n",

      "\n",
      "There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\n",
      "after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to\n",
      "run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he\n",

      "When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\n",

      "too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in\n",

      "that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it; a\n",
      "little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter-shop--carpenters and\n",
      "printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty,\n",
      "littered-up place, and had ink-marks, and handbills with pictures of\n",
      "horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke shed\n",

      "the camp-meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a\n",
      "most awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from\n",
      "twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\n",
      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off\n",
      "the flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",
      "branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles\n",
      "of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they\n",
      "was bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of\n",
      "outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive\n",
      "sticks into for legs. They didn't have no backs. The preachers had\n",
      "high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on\n",
      "sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones,\n",
      "and a few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was\n",
      "barefooted, and some of the children didn't have on any clothes but\n",
      "just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some\n",
      "of the young folks was courting on the sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined\n",
      "out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\n",
      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\n",
      "he lined out two more for them to sing--and so on. The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side\n",
      "of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the\n",
      "front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and\n",
      "shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he\n",
      "would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around\n",
      "this way and that, shouting, \"It's the brazen serpent in the\n",
      "wilderness! Look upon it and live!\" And people would shout out,\n",
      "\"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\" And so he went on, and the people groaning and\n",
      "crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_amen!_)\n",
      "come, sick and sore! (_amen!_) come, lame and halt and blind!\n",
      "(_amen!_) come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_a-a-men!_) come, all\n",
      "that's worn and soiled and suffering!--come with a broken spirit! come\n",
      "with a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters\n",

      "be at rest!\" (_a-a-men! glory, glory hallelujah!_)\n",
      "\n",
      "And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on\n",
      "account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the\n",
      "crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners'\n",
      "bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the\n",
      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung\n",
      "and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and\n",
      "wild.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\n",
      "over everybody; and next he went a-charging up onto the platform, and\n",
      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing\n",
      "that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy\n",
      "for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to\n",
      "start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in\n",
      "the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path;\n",
      "for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all\n",
      "pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time\n",
      "to get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time\n",
      "he convinced a pirate he would say to him, \"Don't you thank me, don't\n",
      "you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville\n",
      "camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that\n",
      "dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody\n",
      "sings out, \"Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!\" Well,\n",
      "a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \"Let\n",
      "_him_ pass the hat around!\" Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the king went all through the crowd with his hat, swabbing his\n",
      "eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for\n",
      "being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little\n",
      "while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their\n",
      "cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to\n",
      "remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and\n",
      "kissed as many as five or six times--and he was invited to stay a\n",
      "week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said\n",
      "they'd think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of\n",
      "the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in a sweat\n",
      "to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\n",
      "collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had\n",
      "fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\n",
      "wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said, take\n",
      "it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\n",
      "missionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't\n",
      "amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king\n",
      "come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He\n",
      "had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\n",
      "printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. And he\n",
      "had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which\n",
      "he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in\n",
      "advance--so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a\n",
      "year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on\n",
      "condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in\n",
      "cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the\n",
      "concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and\n",
      "was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry,\n",
      "which he made, himself, out of his own head--three verses--kind of\n",
      "sweet and saddish--the name of it was, \"Yes, crush, cold world, this\n",
      "breaking heart\"--and he left that all set up and ready to print in the\n",
      "paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars\n",
      "and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\n",
      "for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\n",
      "a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \"$200 reward\" under it. The\n",
      "reading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot. It said he\n",
      "run away from St. Jacques's plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\n",
      "last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and\n",
      "send him back he could have the reward and expenses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" says the duke, \"after to-night we can run in the daytime if we\n",
      "want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot\n",
      "with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say\n",
      "we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a\n",
      "steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and\n",
      "are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look\n",
      "still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of us\n",
      "being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing--we\n",
      "must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn't be no\n",
      "trouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough\n",
      "that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the\n",

      "Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out\n",

      "himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the\n",
      "raft was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell\n",

      "about fifteen minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right\n",
      "away. But it didn't do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and\n",
      "throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away\n",

      "drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it\n",
      "out--and after that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his\n",

      "laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging\n",
      "most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side,\n",

      "and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next\n",
      "minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse\n",
      "a-going like a house afire, too. He just stood up there, a-sailing\n",
      "around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his\n",
      "life--and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He\n",
      "shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he\n",
      "shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and\n",
      "dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that\n",
      "horse with his whip and made him fairly hum--and finally skipped off,\n",
      "and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody\n",

      "Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out\n",
      "in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river,\n",
      "and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them\n",
      "towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take\n",
      "but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when\n",
      "he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when\n",
      "we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened\n",
      "on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he\n",
      "was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard\n",
      "to have to lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get\n",
      "around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He\n",
      "dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico\n",
      "gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his\n",
      "theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all\n",
      "over a dead, dull solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine\n",
      "days. Blamed if he warn't the horriblest-looking outrage I ever see.\n",
      "Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head._\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or\n",
      "five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a\n",
      "sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and\n",
      "trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to\n",
      "make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around,\n",
      "he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl\n",
      "or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and\n",
      "leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the\n",
      "average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only\n",
      "look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",
      "so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because\n",
      "maybe the news might 'a' worked along down by this time. They couldn't\n",
      "hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he\n",
      "reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he\n",
      "couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he\n",
      "allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan, but\n",
      "just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way--meaning the\n",
      "devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped\n",
      "last; and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I\n",
      "done it, of course. The king's duds was all black, and he did look\n",
      "real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body\n",
      "before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever\n",
      "was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow\n",
      "and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say\n",
      "he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus\n",
      "himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There\n",
      "was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about\n",
      "three mile above the town--been there a couple of hours, taking on\n",
      "freight. Says the king:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I\n",
      "fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\n",
      "scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come\n",
      "to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log\n",
      "swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather;\n",
      "and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Run her nose inshore,\" says the king. I done it. \"Wher' you bound\n",

      "\n",
      "\"For the steamboat; going to Orleans.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Adolphus\"--meaning me, I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was\n",
      "mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such\n",
      "weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him\n",
      "he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning,\n",
      "and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up\n",
      "there. The young fellow says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\n",

      "mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would 'a' give\n",
      "anything in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about\n",
      "nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter\n",
      "said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this\n",
      "time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young\n",
      "to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and\n",
      "so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't\n",

      "Harvey--and William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain't\n",

      "\"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Was Peter Wilks well off?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon\n",
      "she got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\n",
      "my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\n",
      "another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\n",
      "carpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and\n",
      "git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I\n",
      "got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\n",
      "log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\n",
      "said it--every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he\n",
      "tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\n",
      "a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but\n",
      "he really done it pretty good. Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and\n",
      "dumb person on the histrionic boards. So then they waited for a\n",
      "steamboat.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\n",
      "but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\n",
      "was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went\n",
      "aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only\n",
      "wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a\n",
      "cussing, and said they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on\n",
      "and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to\n",
      "the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down\n",
      "when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\" they\n",
      "give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to\n",
      "say, \"What 'd I tell you?\" Then one of them says, kind of soft and\n",
      "gentle:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\n",
      "live yesterday evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went all to smash, and fell up\n",
      "against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,\n",
      "it's too, too hard!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\n",
      "the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\n",
      "sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the\n",

      "shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds? No--that\n",
      "won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\n",
      "make it warm for me. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No--I\n",
      "dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\n",
      "money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it. If she was to\n",

      "ain't a-going to leave till they've played this family and this town\n",
      "for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal\n",
      "it and hide it; and by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll\n",
      "write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it\n",

      "\n",
      "So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall was\n",

      "my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\n",
      "anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went\n",
      "to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn't do\n",
      "nothing without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I\n",
      "judged I'd got to do the other thing--lay for them and eavesdrop.\n",
      "About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip\n",
      "under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it\n",
      "would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I\n",
      "jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood\n",
      "there perfectly still. They come in and shut the door; and the first\n",
      "thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed. Then I was\n",
      "glad I hadn't found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it's\n",
      "kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything\n",

      "\n",

      "off and lighting out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would 'a'\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What! And not sell out the rest o' the property? March off like a\n",

      "\n",

      "suff'rers; because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own\n",
      "it--which won't be long after we've slid--the sale won't be valid, and\n",
      "it 'll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans 'll git their\n",

      "\"Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for _him?_ Hain't we got all the\n",

      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I\n",
      "tried to think what I'd better do if they did catch me. But the king\n",
      "he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought,\n",
      "and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved the bag\n",
      "through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed, and\n",
      "crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all\n",
      "right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don't\n",

      "could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside of\n",
      "the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the\n",
      "house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in,\n",

      "peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see the men that\n",
      "was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs. The door was\n",
      "open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and there was a\n",
      "candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was open;\n",
      "but I see there warn't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter; so\n",
      "I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't\n",
      "there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back behind\n",
      "me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the only\n",
      "place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was shoved\n",

      "eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes; never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet awhile. They\n",

      "see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was\n",
      "to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.\n",
      "No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of\n",
      "them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say\n",
      "you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change,\n",
      "or to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, it sha'n't be.\" It was well enough to tell _her_ so--no\n",

      "the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here\n",
      "below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost\n",
      "nothing. Then I says: \"There's one more thing--that bag of money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think\n",

      "I'm just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did\n",
      "honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow\n",

      "to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by\n",
      "the hand, hard, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Good_-by. I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if\n",
      "I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you, and I'll think\n",

      "she was gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was\n",
      "more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same--she was\n",
      "just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the\n",
      "notion--there warn't no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what\n",
      "you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl\n",
      "I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like\n",
      "flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and\n",
      "goodness, too--she lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since\n",
      "that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen\n",
      "her since, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and a many a\n",

      "\n",
      "The duke bristles up now, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, let _up_ on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame'\n",

      "\"Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and\n",

      "\n",
      "I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier\n",

      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It's _well_ for you to set\n",

      "everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own\n",
      "father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it\n",
      "saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.\n",
      "It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_\n",
      "that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make\n",
      "up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the\n",
      "'None-such' and one thing or another, and scoop it _all!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\n",

      "\"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffersit; it warn't me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!\" says the duke. \"And\n",
      "_now_ you see what you _got_ by it. They've got all their own money\n",

      "tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each\n",
      "other's arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king\n",
      "didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about\n",
      "hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of\n",

      "\n",
      "We dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along\n",
      "down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a\n",
      "mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish\n",
      "moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It\n",
      "was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn\n",
      "and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and\n",
      "they begun to work the villages again.\n",
      "\n",
      "First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\n",
      "for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a\n",
      "dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a\n",
      "kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped\n",
      "in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at\n",
      "yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up\n",
      "and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They\n",
      "tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling\n",
      "fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have\n",
      "no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around\n",
      "the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying\n",
      "nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together\n",
      "in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a\n",
      "time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged\n",
      "they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned\n",
      "it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to\n",
      "break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the\n",
      "counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty\n",
      "scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the\n",
      "world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we\n",
      "would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind.\n",
      "Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about\n",
      "two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and\n",
      "the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up\n",
      "to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the\n",
      "\"Royal Nonesuch\" there yet. (\"House to rob, you _mean_,\" says I to\n",
      "myself; \"and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and\n",
      "wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft--and you'll have to\n",
      "take it out in wondering.\") And he said if he warn't back by midday\n",
      "the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and\n",
      "was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we\n",
      "couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little\n",
      "thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday\n",
      "come and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance\n",
      "for _the_ chance on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the\n",
      "village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found\n",
      "him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of\n",
      "loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening\n",
      "with all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do\n",
      "nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and\n",
      "the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I\n",
      "lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the\n",
      "river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind\n",
      "that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I\n",
      "got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Set her loose, Jim; we're all right now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was\n",
      "gone! I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and\n",
      "run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it\n",
      "warn't no use--old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn't\n",
      "help it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the\n",
      "road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy\n",
      "walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and\n",
      "so, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whereabouts?\" says I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Down to Silas Phelps's place, two mile below here. He's a runaway\n",
      "nigger, and they've got him. Was you looking for him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two\n",
      "ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to\n",
      "lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since;\n",
      "afeard to come out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he says, \"you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got\n",
      "him. He run off f'm down South som'ers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a good job they got him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I _reckon!_ There's two hundred dollars dollars' reward on him.\n",
      "It's like picking up money out'n the road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is--and I could 'a' had it if I'd been big enough; I see him\n",
      "_first_. Who nailed him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him\n",
      "for forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.\n",
      "Think o' that, now! You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's me, every time,\" says I. \"But maybe his chance ain't worth no\n",
      "more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something\n",
      "ain't straight about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it _is_, though--straight as a string. I see the handbill myself.\n",

      "the plantation he's frum, below Newr_leans_. No-sirree-_bob_, they\n",
      "ain't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a\n",
      "chaw tobacker, won't ye?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in\n",
      "the wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I\n",
      "wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble. After\n",
      "all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels,\n",
      "here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined,\n",
      "because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that,\n",
      "and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,\n",
      "for forty dirty dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to\n",
      "be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be a\n",
      "slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to\n",
      "tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two\n",
      "things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness\n",
      "for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;\n",
      "and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\n",
      "and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and\n",
      "disgraced. And then think of _me!_ It would get all around that Huck\n",
      "Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see\n",
      "anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his\n",
      "boots for shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing,\n",
      "and then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long\n",
      "as he can hide, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The\n",
      "more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me,\n",
      "and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at\n",
      "last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of\n",
      "Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness\n",
      "was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was\n",
      "stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm,\n",
      "and now was showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and\n",
      "ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur\n",
      "and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I\n",
      "tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by\n",
      "saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but\n",
      "something inside of me kept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you\n",
      "could 'a' gone to it; and if you'd 'a' done it they'd 'a' learnt you\n",
      "there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes\n",
      "to everlasting fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\n",
      "couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I\n",
      "kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It\n",
      "warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I\n",
      "knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart\n",
      "warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was\n",
      "playing double. I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of\n",
      "me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my\n",
      "mouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and\n",
      "write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in\n",
      "me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie--I\n",
      "found that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\n",
      "do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the\n",
      "letter--and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I\n",
      "felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all\n",
      "gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited,\n",
      "and set down and wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\n",
      "Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\n",
      "reward if you send. HUCK FINN.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\n",
      "felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it\n",
      "straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\n",
      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being\n",
      "lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over\n",
      "our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the\n",
      "day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and\n",
      "we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only\n",
      "the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead\n",
      "of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was\n",
      "when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the\n",
      "swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would\n",
      "always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of\n",
      "for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I\n",
      "saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard, and he was so\n",
      "grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the\n",
      "world, and the _only_ one he's got now; and then I happened to look\n",
      "around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,\n",
      "and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and\n",
      "then says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up. It was awful\n",
      "thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said;\n",
      "and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing\n",
      "out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was\n",
      "in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And for a\n",
      "starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if\n",
      "I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long\n",
      "as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with\n",
      "my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept\n",
      "the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my\n",
      "breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and\n",
      "one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for\n",
      "shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my\n",
      "bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and\n",
      "loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I\n",
      "wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam-sawmill\n",
      "that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, \"Phelps's Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there\n",
      "from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved\n",
      "along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got\n",
      "there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the \"Royal\n",
      "Nonesuch--three-night performance--like that other time. They had the\n",
      "cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked\n",
      "astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo!_ Where'd _you_ come from?\" Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, \"Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" says the old man, \"I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you\n",

      "voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through\n",
      "the middle of it--it was as much as half after eight then--here comes\n",
      "a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and\n",
      "yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one\n",
      "side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king\n",
      "and the duke astraddle of a rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king\n",
      "and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't\n",
      "look like nothing in the world that was human--just looked like a\n",
      "couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see\n",
      "it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I\n",
      "couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It\n",

      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see we was too late--couldn't do no good. We asked some stragglers\n",
      "about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\n",
      "innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\n",
      "middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal,\n",
      "and the house rose up and went for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\n",
      "before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Ready?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right--bring it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My plan is this,\" I says. \"We can easy find out if it's Jim in there.\n",
      "Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the\n",
      "island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the\n",
      "old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river\n",
      "on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me\n",
      "and Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Work?_ Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it's\n",
      "too blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it. What's the good of a\n",
      "plan that ain't no more trouble than that? It's as mild as goose-milk.\n",
      "Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap\n",
      "factory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different;\n",
      "but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got _his_ plan ready it\n",
      "wouldn't have none of them objections to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was\n",
      "worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man\n",
      "as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was\n",
      "satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what it\n",
      "was here, because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way it was. I knowed\n",
      "he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and\n",
      "heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what\n",
      "he done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\n",
      "earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of\n",
      "slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy\n",
      "that was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose;\n",
      "and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not\n",
      "leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind;\n",
      "and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling,\n",
      "than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his\n",
      "family a shame, before everybody. I _couldn't_ understand it no way at\n",
      "all. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him\n",
      "so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where\n",
      "he was and save himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me\n",
      "up, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know what\n",

      "\n",
      "That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't no use to say any\n",
      "more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it. But I\n",
      "couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\n",
      "let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to\n",

      "\n",
      "When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down\n",

      "yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't\n",
      "make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything\n",
      "comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the\n",
      "front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted\n",
      "with--which was the north side--we found a square window-hole, up\n",
      "tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if\n",
      "we wrench off the board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" I says, \"how'll it do to saw him out, the way I done\n",
      "before I was murdered that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's more _like_,\" he says. \"It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\n",
      "and good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\n",
      "There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was\n",
      "at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle\n",
      "and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid\n",
      "with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell\n",
      "down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a\n",
      "match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no\n",
      "connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing\n",
      "in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a\n",
      "crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the\n",
      "staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.\n",
      "He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only\n",
      "have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but\n",
      "that warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but\n",
      "he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half-way about\n",
      "three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time\n",
      "most busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but\n",
      "after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for\n",
      "luck, and this time he made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger\n",
      "cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed\n",
      "Jim--if it _was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting\n",
      "through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was\n",
      "piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the\n",
      "others was leaving, the key come from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches\n",
      "off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",
      "So Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mars Sid, _a_ dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look\n",

      "\"No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now._\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much. When we got in\n",
      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there,\n",
      "sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n",

      "I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn't know\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's mighty curious. _Who_ sung out? _When_ did he sing out?\n",
      "_What_ did he sing out?\" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\n",
      "\"Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; _I_ ain't heard nobody say nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did you sing out?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway? What made you think\n",

      "As soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down\n",
      "the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out\n",
      "our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of\n",
      "the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.\n",

      "the ground, and you'd have to raise it up and look under to see the\n",
      "hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and\n",
      "then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. If we was prisoners\n",

      "like it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way: we got to\n",

      "\n",
      "\"_Now_ you're _talking!_\" I says; \"your head gets leveler and leveler\n",

      "nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a\n",
      "Sunday-school book, I ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's\n",
      "done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he says, \"there's excuse for picks and letting on in a case\n",
      "like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't\n",
      "stand by and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is\n",
      "wrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't\n",
      "ignorant and knows better. It might answer for _you_ to dig Jim out\n",
      "with a pick, _without_ any letting on, because you don't know no\n",

      "\n",
      "He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought. I scratched around\n",
      "amongst the old tools, and got a pickax and give it to him, and he\n",
      "took it and went to work, and never said a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was always just that particular. Full of principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\n",
      "and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was\n",
      "as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show\n",
      "for it. When I got up-stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom\n",
      "doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it,\n",
      "his hands was so sore. At last he says:\n",
      "\n",

      "let on it's a lightning-rod.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he done it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the\n",
      "house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles;\n",
      "and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole\n",
      "three tin plates. Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody\n",
      "wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall\n",
      "in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we\n",
      "could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was\n",
      "satisfied. Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take them in through the hole,\" I says, \"when we get it done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever\n",
      "heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by\n",
      "he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no\n",
      "need to decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got to post Jim first.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and\n",
      "heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then\n",
      "we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a\n",
      "half the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin,\n",
      "and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim\n",
      "awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him\n",
      "up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and\n",
      "called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for\n",
      "having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with\n",
      "right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he\n",
      "showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all\n",
      "about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time\n",
      "there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would\n",
      "see he got away, _sure_. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set\n",
      "there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of\n",
      "questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two\n",
      "to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable\n",
      "and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Now_ I know how to fix it. We'll send you some things by them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, \"Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\n",
      "ideas I ever struck\"; but he never paid no attention to me; went right\n",
      "on. It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and\n",
      "other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on\n",
      "the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them;\n",
      "and we would put small things in uncle's coat pockets and he must\n",
      "steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put\n",
      "them in her apron pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they\n",
      "would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on\n",
      "the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he\n",
      "couldn't see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white\n",
      "folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he\n",
      "would do it all just as Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we\n",
      "would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our\n",
      "children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better\n",
      "and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it\n",
      "could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best\n",
      "time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a\n",
      "hand in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\n",
      "his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could 'a'\n",
      "worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it\n",
      "was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always\n",
      "getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing\n",
      "but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\n",
      "couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on\n",
      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\n",
      "in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that\n",
      "lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and\n",
      "keeled over onto the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like\n",
      "he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's\n",

      "count--anybody would.\n",
      "\n",

      "in the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!\" and she looked huffy\n",
      "and bothered both. But Tom says:\n",

      "\"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You numskull, didn't you see me _count_ 'm?\"\n",

      "\"I know, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll count 'm again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\n",
      "Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was\n",
      "so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd\n",
      "start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three\n",
      "times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then\n",
      "she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked\n",
      "the cat galley-west; and she said cler out and let her have some\n",
      "peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and\n",
      "dinner she'd skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her\n",
      "apron pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim\n",
      "got it all right, along with her shingle-nail, before noon. We was\n",
      "very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth\n",
      "twice the trouble it took, because he said _now_ she couldn't ever\n",
      "count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn't\n",
      "believe she'd counted them right if she _did_; and said that after\n",
      "she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged\n",
      "she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever\n",
      "count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\n",
      "she druther die first.\n",

      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it\n",
      "would blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and\n",
      "we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through,\n",
      "and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out\n",
      "with the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust,\n",
      "and we couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of\n",
      "course we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the\n",
      "ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night,\n",
      "and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together,\n",
      "and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could 'a' hung\n",
      "a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\n",
      "into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\n",
      "enough for forty pies if we'd 'a' wanted them, and plenty left over\n",
      "for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could 'a' had a whole\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\n",
      "so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the\n",
      "washpan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\n",

      "you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but\n",
      "she failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come\n",
      "up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set\n",
      "her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough\n",
      "roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off\n",
      "five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen\n",
      "minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But\n",

      "toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to\n",

      "papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold\n",
      "shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now for the\n",
      "nonnamous letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's them?\" I says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it's done one\n",
      "way, sometimes another. But there's always somebody spying around that\n",
      "gives notice to the governor of the castle. When Louis XVI. was going\n",
      "to light out of the Tooleries a servant-girl done it. It's a very good\n",
      "way, and so is the nonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it's\n",
      "usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\n",
      "stays in, and he slides out in her clothes. We'll do that, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to _warn_ anybody for that\n",
      "something's up? Let them find it out for themselves--it's their\n",
      "lookout.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them. It's the way they've acted\n",
      "from the very start--left us to do _everything_. They're so confiding\n",
      "and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So if we\n",
      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to\n",
      "interfere with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this\n",
      "escape 'll go off perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shucks!\" he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ain't going to make no complaint. Any way that suits you suits\n",
      "me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook\n",
      "that yaller girl's frock.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You wouldn't look like a servant-girl _then_, would you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ain't got nothing to do with it. The thing for us to do is just\n",
      "to do our _duty_, and not worry about whether anybody _sees_ us do it\n",
      "or not. Hain't you got no principle at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his\n",
      "bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger\n",
      "woman's gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When\n",
      "a prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It's always called\n",
      "so when a king escapes, f'rinstance. And the same with a king's son;\n",
      "it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural\n",
      "one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller\n",
      "wench's frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front\n",

      "\n",
      "So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a\n",

      "to look like they warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was\n",
      "always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching\n",
      "their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their\n",

      "more of you till morning!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was up-stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another\n",
      "one, and shinning through the dark for the lean-to. I couldn't hardly\n",
      "get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could\n",
      "we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of\n",
      "men, yonder, with guns!\n",
      "\n",
      "His eyes just blazed; and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!--is that so? _Ain't_ it bully! Why, Huck, if it was to do over\n",
      "again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If we could put it off till--\"\n",

      "\"Hurry! _hurry!_\" I says. \"Where's Jim?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\n",
      "He's dressed, and everything's ready. Now we'll slide out and give the\n",
      "sheep-signal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\n",
      "begin to fumble with the padlock, and heard a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I _told_ you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.\n",
      "Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the\n",
      "dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,\n",
      "and listen if you can hear 'em coming.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us\n",
      "whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all\n",
      "right, and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next,\n",
      "and Tom last, which was according to Tom's orders. Now we was in the\n",
      "lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to the\n",
      "door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but\n",
      "couldn't make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he\n",
      "would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim\n",
      "must glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and\n",
      "listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around\n",
      "out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and\n",
      "stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and\n",
      "slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all\n",
      "right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a\n",
      "splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had\n",
      "to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he\n",
      "dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then\n",
      "there was a rush, and a _bang,_ _bang,_ _bang!_ and the bullets fairly\n",
      "whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys, and turn\n",
      "loose the dogs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore\n",
      "boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We was\n",
      "in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us we\n",
      "dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\n",
      "them. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the\n",
      "robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\n",
      "come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\n",
      "stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it\n",
      "warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just\n",
      "said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering;\n",
      "and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was\n",
      "nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my\n",
      "canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the\n",
      "middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was\n",
      "obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island\n",
      "where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each\n",
      "other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got\n",
      "dim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, old Jim, you're a free man _again_, and I bet you won't ever be\n",
      "a slave no more.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all\n",
      "because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel as brash as what we did\n",
      "before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him\n",
      "in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him,\n",
      "but he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don't stop now; don't fool around\n",
      "here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and\n",
      "set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!--'deed we did. I wish _we'd_\n",
      "'a' had the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't 'a' been no 'Son of\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking. And after we'd thought a\n",
      "minute, I says:\n",

      "\"Say it, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he says:\n",

      "\n",
      "I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did\n",
      "say--so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a\n",
      "doctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to\n",
      "it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft\n",
      "loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his\n",
      "mind, but it didn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\n",

      "You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of\n",
      "_The Adventures of Tom Sawyer;_ but that ain't no matter. That book\n",
      "was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was\n",
      "things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is\n",
      "nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it\n",
      "was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt\n",
      "Polly, she is--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in\n",
      "that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I\n",
      "said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apiece--all gold. It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at\n",
      "interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "round--more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old\n",
      "thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had\n",
      "to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to\n",
      "eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and\n",
      "grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really\n",
      "anything the matter with them--that is, nothing only everything was\n",
      "cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things\n",
      "get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go\n",
      "better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time;\n",
      "so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock\n",
      "in dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she\n",
      "wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she\n",
      "was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to\n",
      "anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for\n",
      "doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of\n",
      "course that was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "\"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry\"; and \"Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberry--set up straight\"; and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, \"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try\n",
      "to behave?\" Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I\n",
      "wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I\n",
      "wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't\n",
      "particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she\n",
      "wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go\n",
      "to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where\n",
      "she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never\n",
      "said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the\n",
      "good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go\n",
      "around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I\n",
      "didn't think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she\n",
      "reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable\n",
      "sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      "By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so\n",
      "lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was\n",
      "trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it\n",
      "was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the\n",
      "woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to\n",
      "tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself\n",
      "understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about\n",
      "that way every night grieving. I got so downhearted and scared I did\n",
      "wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my\n",
      "shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I\n",
      "could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me\n",
      "that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I\n",
      "was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned\n",
      "around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and\n",
      "then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches\n",
      "away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a\n",
      "horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door,\n",
      "but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad\n",
      "luck when you'd killed a spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\n",
      "go boom--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\n",
      "trees--something was a-stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I\n",
      "could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there. That was good!\n",
      "Says I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back toward the end\n",
      "of the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't\n",
      "scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a\n",
      "root and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss Watson's\n",
      "big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see\n",
      "him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He got up and\n",
      "stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who dah?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he came tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could 'a' touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so\n",
      "close together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but\n",
      "I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      "Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you are with the\n",
      "quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepy--if you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upward of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do: I's gwyne to set down here and\n",
      "listen tell I hears it ag'in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most\n",
      "touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears\n",
      "come into my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begun to itch on the\n",
      "inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I didn't know how I was\n",
      "going to set still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven\n",
      "minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. I was itching in\n",
      "eleven different places now. I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a\n",
      "minute longer, but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then\n",
      "Jim begun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore--and then I was\n",
      "pretty soon comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to me--kind of a little noise with his mouth--and\n",
      "we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot off\n",
      "Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But I\n",
      "said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find\n",
      "out I warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he\n",
      "would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't want him to try.\n",
      "I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom wanted to resk it; so we\n",
      "slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the\n",
      "table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but\n",
      "nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands\n",
      "and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it seemed a good\n",
      "while, everything was so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden\n",
      "fence, and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other\n",
      "side of the house. Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and\n",
      "hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he\n",
      "didn't wake. Afterward Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him\n",
      "in a trance, and rode him all over the state, and then set him under\n",
      "the trees again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And\n",
      "next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and,\n",
      "after that, every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by\n",
      "and by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to\n",
      "death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud\n",
      "about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.\n",
      "Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more\n",
      "looked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would\n",
      "stand with their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was\n",
      "a wonder. Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the\n",
      "kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all\n",
      "about such things, Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm! What you know\n",
      "'bout witches?\" and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back\n",
      "seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a\n",
      "string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own\n",
      "hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches\n",
      "whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never\n",
      "told what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around\n",
      "there and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that\n",
      "five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because the devil had\n",
      "had his hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got\n",
      "stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away\n",
      "down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling,\n",
      "where there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling\n",
      "ever so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile\n",
      "broad, and awful still and grand. We went down the hill and found Joe\n",
      "Harper and Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the\n",
      "old tanyard. So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two\n",
      "mile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon\n",
      "ducked under a wall where you wouldn't 'a' noticed that there was a\n",
      "hole. We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all\n",
      "damp and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his\n",
      "name in blood.\" Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper\n",
      "that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to\n",
      "stick to the band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody\n",
      "done anything to any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to\n",
      "kill that person and his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he\n",
      "mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their\n",
      "breasts, which was the sign of the band. And nobody that didn't belong\n",
      "to the band could use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if\n",
      "he done it again he must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to\n",
      "the band told the secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have\n",
      "his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and his name\n",
      "blotted off the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang,\n",
      "but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head. He said some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and\n",
      "wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hain't he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days. He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been\n",
      "seen in these parts for a year or more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think\n",
      "of anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still. I was most\n",
      "ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered\n",
      "them Miss Watson--they could kill her. Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",

      "\"But who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,\"\n",
      "says Tom Sawyer. \"We ain't burglars. That ain't no sort of style. We\n",
      "are highwaymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\n",
      "on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must we always kill the people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill them--except some that you bring\n",
      "to the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ransomed? What's that?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, blame it all, we've _got_ to do it. Don't I tell you it's in the\n",
      "books?  Do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books,\n",
      "and get things all muddled up?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "it is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep them till they're\n",

      "bothersome lot they'll be, too--eating up everything, and always\n",
      "trying to get loose.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there's a guard\n",
      "over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A guard! Well, that _is_ good. So somebody's got to set up all night\n",
      "and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them. I think that's\n",
      "foolishness. Why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as\n",
      "they get here?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because it ain't in the books so--that's why. Now, Ben Rogers, do you\n",

      "reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct\n",
      "thing to do? Do you reckon _you_ can learn 'em anything? Not by a good\n",
      "deal. No, sir, we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a fool way, anyhow. Say, do\n",
      "we kill the women, too?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn't let on. Kill\n",
      "the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that. You\n",
      "fetch them to the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;\n",
      "and by and by they fall in love with you, and never want to go home\n",
      "any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don't take no stock in it.\n",
      "Mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women, and\n",

      "cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I\n",
      "would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the\n",
      "closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every\n",
      "day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn't so. I\n",
      "tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn't any good to\n",
      "me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four times, but\n",
      "somehow I couldn't make it work. By and by, one day, I asked Miss\n",
      "Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She never told me\n",
      "why, and I couldn't make it out no way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.\n",

      "get back her silver snuff-box that was stole? Why can't Miss Watson\n",
      "fat up? No, says I to myself, there ain't nothing in it. I went and\n",
      "told the widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by\n",
      "praying for it was \"spiritual gifts.\" This was too many for me, but\n",
      "she told me what she meant--I must help other people, and do\n",
      "everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the\n",
      "time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss Watson, as\n",
      "I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a\n",
      "long time, but I couldn't see no advantage about it--except for the\n",
      "other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about it any\n",
      "more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me one side\n",
      "and talk about Providence in a way to make a body's mouth water; but\n",
      "maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down\n",
      "again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and a poor\n",

      "Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable\n",

      "to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well, about this\n",
      "time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town,\n",
      "so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man\n",
      "was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which\n",
      "was all like pap; but they couldn't make nothing out of the face,\n",
      "because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at\n",

      "of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow\n",
      "with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and over a\n",
      "thousand \"sumter\" mules, all loaded down with di'monds, and they\n",
      "didn't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would lay\n",
      "in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the things.\n",
      "He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready. He never\n",
      "could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns\n",
      "all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and broomsticks, and\n",
      "you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they warn't worth a\n",
      "mouthful of ashes more than what they was before. I didn't believe we\n",

      "the camels and elephants, so I was on hand next day, Saturday, in the\n",
      "ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and\n",
      "down the hill. But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs, and there\n",
      "warn't no camels nor no elephants. It warn't anything but a\n",
      "Sunday-school picnic, and only a primer class at that. We busted it\n",
      "up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we never got anything\n",
      "but some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Joe\n",
      "Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the teacher charged in,\n",
      "and made us drop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds, and I\n",
      "told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and\n",
      "he said there was A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said,\n",
      "why couldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't so ignorant, but\n",
      "had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He\n",
      "said it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of\n",
      "soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had\n",
      "enemies which he called magicians, and they had turned the whole thing\n",
      "into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right;\n",
      "then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer\n",

      "\"Why,\" said he, \"a magician could call up a lot of genies, and they\n",

      "come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and\n",
      "the smoke a-rolling, and everything they're told to do they up and do\n",
      "it. They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots,\n",
      "and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it--or\n",
      "any other man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who makes them tear around so?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to whoever rubs\n",
      "the lamp or the ring, and they've got to do whatever he says. If he\n",
      "tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, and\n",
      "fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an\n",
      "emperor's daughter from China for you to marry, they've got to do\n",
      "it--and they've got to do it before sun-up next morning, too. And\n",
      "more: they've got to waltz that palace around over the country\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" says I, \"I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping\n",

      "took fish-lines and matches and other things--everything that was\n",
      "worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an ax, but there\n",
      "wasn't any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was\n",
      "going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and\n",
      "dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from\n",
      "the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the\n",
      "smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into\n",
      "its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it\n",
      "there, for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground.\n",
      "If you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you\n",
      "wouldn't never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin,\n",
      "and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track. I\n",
      "followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the\n",
      "river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the\n",
      "prairie-farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the ax and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back\n",
      "nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the ax, and laid\n",
      "him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was\n",
      "ground--hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and\n",
      "put a lot of big rocks in it--all I could drag--and I started it from\n",
      "the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the\n",
      "river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy\n",
      "see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom\n",
      "Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of\n",
      "business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself\n",
      "like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the ax good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the ax in the corner. Then I took\n",
      "up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the\n",
      "house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in\n",
      "the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on\n",
      "the place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.\n",
      "Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and\n",
      "through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five\n",
      "mile wide and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the\n",
      "season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other\n",
      "side that went miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the\n",
      "river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the\n",
      "lake. I dropped pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had\n",
      "been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal-sack with a\n",
      "string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the\n",
      "canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under\n",
      "some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.\n",
      "I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to\n",
      "myself, they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore\n",
      "and then drag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to\n",
      "the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find\n",
      "the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt\n",
      "the river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of\n",
      "that, and won't bother no more about me. All right; I can stop\n",
      "anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know\n",
      "that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can\n",
      "paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I\n",
      "want. Jackson's Island's the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I\n",
      "woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across. The moon was so bright I could 'a' counted the\n",
      "drift-logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of\n",
      "yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late,\n",
      "and _smelt_ late. You know what I mean--I don't know the words to put\n",
      "it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and\n",
      "start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty\n",
      "soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that\n",
      "comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped\n",
      "out through the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away\n",
      "across the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept\n",
      "a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man\n",
      "in it. Thinks I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He\n",
      "dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up\n",
      "shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could 'a' reached\n",
      "out the gun and touched him. Well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and\n",
      "sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down-stream\n",
      "soft, but quick, in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more toward the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry-landing,\n",
      "and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood,\n",
      "and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I\n",
      "laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      "And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry-landing. I heard what they said, too--every word\n",
      "of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now. T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckoned--and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old\n",
      "woman--she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more\n",
      "than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further\n",
      "away, and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the\n",
      "mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down-stream, heavy-timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid,\n",
      "like a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar\n",
      "at the head--it was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a\n",
      "deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could 'a' seen the\n",
      "canoe from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the\n",
      "town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.\n",
      "A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile upstream, coming along\n",
      "down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping\n",
      "down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say,\n",
      "\"Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\" I heard that just as\n",
      "plain as if the man was by my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods,\n",
      "and laid down for a nap before breakfast.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\n",
      "o'clock. I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there. A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at\n",
      "me very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortable--didn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of \"boom!\" away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways up--about abreast the ferry. And there was\n",
      "the ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was\n",
      "the matter now. \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the\n",
      "ferryboat's side. You see, they was firing cannon over the water,\n",
      "trying to make my carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide\n",
      "there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning--so I was having\n",
      "a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a\n",
      "bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put\n",
      "quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always\n",
      "go right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep\n",
      "a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me I'll give\n",
      "them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what\n",
      "luck I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A big double loaf come\n",
      "along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and\n",
      "she floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the\n",
      "closest to the shore--I knowed enough for that. But by and by along\n",
      "comes another one, and this time I won. I took out the plug and shook\n",
      "out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my teeth in. It was\n",
      "\"baker's bread\"--what the quality eat; none of your low-down\n",
      "corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log,\n",
      "munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well\n",
      "satisfied. And then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the\n",
      "widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me,\n",
      "and here it has gone and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there is\n",
      "something in that thing--that is, there's something in it when a body\n",
      "like the widow or the parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I\n",
      "reckon it don't work for only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a\n",
      "chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would\n",
      "come in close, where the bread did. When she'd got pretty well along\n",
      "down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the\n",
      "bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.\n",
      "Where the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",

      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",

      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge. I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the rails,\n",
      "nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might. I\n",
      "could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain\n",
      "sung out: \"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right\n",
      "before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind\n",
      "with the smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they'd 'a' had some\n",
      "bullets in, I reckon they'd 'a' got the corpse they was after. Well, I\n",
      "see I warn't hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went\n",
      "out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the\n",
      "booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an\n",
      "hour, I didn't hear it no more. The island was three mile long. I\n",
      "judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up. But they didn't\n",
      "yet awhile. They turned around the foot of the island and started up\n",
      "the channel on the Missouri side, under steam, and booming once in a\n",
      "while as they went. I crossed over to that side and watched them. When\n",
      "they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped\n",
      "over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the\n",
      "thick woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my\n",
      "things under so the rain couldn't get at them. I catched a catfish and\n",
      "haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my\n",
      "camp-fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp-fire smoking, and feeling pretty\n",
      "well satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went\n",
      "and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and\n",
      "counted the stars and drift-logs and rafts that come down, and then\n",
      "went to bed; there ain't no better way to put in time when you are\n",
      "lonesome; you can't stay so, you soon get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island. I\n",
      "was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.\n",
      "They would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and\n",
      "it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it,\n",
      "trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp-fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst\n",
      "the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't\n",
      "hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened\n",
      "again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if\n",
      "I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut\n",
      "one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around. So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last-year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing, I\n",
      "didn't hear nothing--I only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good and\n",
      "dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bank--about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk_, _plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices. I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn't got far when\n",
      "I hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out. Let's look around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, for thinking. And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust. Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day. I\n",
      "poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.\n",
      "A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as\n",
      "saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the paddle and\n",
      "brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into\n",
      "the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked out\n",
      "through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness\n",
      "begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak\n",
      "over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took my gun and\n",
      "slipped off towards where I had run across that camp-fire, stopping\n",
      "every minute or two to listen. But I hadn't no luck somehow; I\n",
      "couldn't seem to find the place. But by and by, sure enough, I catched\n",

      "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the\n",
      "island that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got\n",
      "to it, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a\n",
      "mile wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep\n",
      "and the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and\n",
      "by and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on\n",
      "the side towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool\n",
      "in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I\n",
      "said we didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the\n",
      "traps in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the\n",
      "island, and they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he\n",
      "said them little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want\n",
      "the things to get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on\n",
      "one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat\n",
      "and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in\n",
      "there. We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.\n",
      "Pretty soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the\n",
      "birds was right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained\n",
      "like all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of\n",
      "these regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all\n",
      "blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so\n",
      "thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby;\n",
      "and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and\n",
      "turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of\n",
      "a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms\n",
      "as if they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest\n",
      "and blackest--_fst!_ it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a\n",
      "little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the\n",
      "storm, hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as\n",
      "sin again in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an\n",
      "awful crash, and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky\n",
      "towards the under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels\n",

      "every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such\n",
      "things; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got\n",
      "so tame, on account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up\n",
      "and put your hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and\n",
      "turtles--they would slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was\n",
      "in was full of them. We could 'a' had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",

      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber-raft--nice pine\n",

      "aboard--clumb in at an up-stairs window. But it was too dark to see\n",

      "there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something laying\n",

      "I reck'n he's ben dead two er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan'\n",
      "look at his face--it's too gashly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him. There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky-bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      "There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's\n",
      "clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe--it might come good.\n",
      "There was a boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that,\n",
      "too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag\n",
      "stopper for a baby to suck. We would 'a' took the bottle, but it was\n",
      "broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the\n",
      "hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them\n",
      "that was any account. The way things was scattered about we reckoned\n",

      "of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of\n",
      "tallow candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and\n",
      "a ratty old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins\n",

      "leg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good\n",

      "with the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger\n",
      "a good ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted\n",

      "over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a\n",

      "though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your\n",
      "left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\n",
      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as\n",
      "big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would 'a' flung\n",
      "us into Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear\n",
      "around till he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a\n",
      "round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the\n",
      "hatchet, and there was a spool in it. Jim said he'd had it there a\n",
      "long time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a\n",
      "fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he\n",

      "must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and said,\n",
      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      "That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.\n",
      "Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on\n",
      "the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look\n",
      "in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim\n",
      "said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practised\n",
      "around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do\n",

      "cornered, and was afeard maybe I was looking it, too. I wished the\n",

      "they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\n",
      "place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was\n",
      "right about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in\n",
      "the corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy\n",
      "to throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no\n",
      "peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said\n",
      "she was a good shot with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day\n",
      "or two ago, and didn't know whether she could throw true now. But she\n",

      "missed him wide, and said, \"Ouch!\" it hurt her arm so. Then she told\n",
      "me to try for the next one. I wanted to be getting away before the old\n",
      "man got back, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing, and the\n",
      "first rat that showed his nose I let drive, and if he'd 'a' stayed\n",
      "where he was he'd 'a' been a tolerable sick rat. She said that was\n",
      "first-rate, and she reckoned I would hive the next one. She went and\n",
      "got the lump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along a hank of\n",
      "yarn which she wanted me to help her with. I held up my two hands and\n",
      "she put the hank over them, and went on talking about her and her\n",

      "mustn't go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother\n",
      "was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the\n",
      "country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I\n",
      "couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days,\n",

      "I traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread\n",

      "I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks\n",
      "and slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house.\n",
      "I jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to\n",
      "make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the\n",

      "the head of the island I never waited to blow, though I was most\n",
      "winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to\n",
      "be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a\n",
      "half below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the\n",

      "asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:\n",

      "ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put\n",
      "out the camp-fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a\n",
      "candle outside after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look;\n",
      "but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and\n",

      "It must 'a' been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island\n",
      "at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to\n",
      "come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the\n",
      "Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever\n",
      "thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to\n",
      "eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things.\n",
      "It warn't good judgment to put _everything_ on the raft.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp-fire I\n",
      "built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed\n",
      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't\n",
      "no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in\n",
      "a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches\n",
      "with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like\n",
      "there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sand-bar\n",
      "that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the\n",
      "Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that\n",
      "place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there\n",
      "all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri\n",
      "shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I\n",
      "told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim\n",
      "said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she\n",
      "wouldn't set down and watch a camp-fire--no, sir, she'd fetch a dog.\n",
      "Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?\n",
      "Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to\n",
      "start, and he believed they must 'a' gone up-town to get a dog and so\n",
      "they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead\n",
      "sixteen or seventeen mile below the village--no, indeedy, we would be\n",
      "in that same old town again. So I said I didn't care what was the\n",
      "reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in\n",
      "sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a\n",
      "snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the\n",
      "things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or\n",
      "more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the\n",
      "traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the\n",
      "wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a\n",
      "frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire\n",
      "on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being\n",
      "seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others\n",
      "might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked\n",
      "stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the\n",
      "lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from\n",
      "getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats\n",
      "unless we see we was in what they call a \"crossing\"; for the river was\n",
      "pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so\n",
      "up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but hunted easy water.\n",
      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs\n",
      "looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud,\n",
      "and it warn't often that we laughed--only a little kind of a low\n",
      "chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing\n",
      "ever happened to us at all--that night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit\n",
      "up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty\n",
      "thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that\n",
      "wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There\n",
      "warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore toward ten o'clock at some\n",
      "little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon\n",
      "or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't\n",
      "roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a\n",
      "chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself\n",
      "you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever\n",
      "forgot. I never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but\n",
      "that is what he used to say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into corn-fields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things\n",
      "of that kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if\n",
      "you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it\n",
      "warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would\n",
      "do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was\n",
      "partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three\n",
      "things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more--then he\n",
      "reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it\n",
      "over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up\n",
      "our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the\n",
      "mushmelons, or what. But toward daylight we got it all settled\n",
      "satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We\n",
      "warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now.\n",
      "I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever\n",
      "good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight,\n",
      "with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a\n",
      "solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of\n",
      "itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight\n",
      "river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I,\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo_, Jim, looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed\n",
      "herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The\n",
      "lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of\n",
      "her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy\n",
      "clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat\n",
      "hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so\n",
      "mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would 'a' felt when\n",
      "I seen that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle\n",
      "of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little,\n",
      "and see what there was there. So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Le's land on her, Jim.\"\n",

      "resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try. \"And besides,\" I says,\n",
      "\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's\n",
      "stateroom. Seegars, I bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.\n",
      "Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and\n",
      "_they_ don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they\n",
      "want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we\n",
      "give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this\n",
      "thing? Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure--that's\n",
      "what he'd call it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act.\n",
      "And wouldn't he throw style into it?--wouldn't he spread himself, nor\n",
      "nothing? Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering\n",
      "Kingdom Come. I wish Tom Sawyer _was_ here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn't talk any\n",
      "more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning\n",
      "showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard\n",
      "derrick, and made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",

      "our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was\n",
      "so dark we couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the\n",
      "forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step\n",
      "fetched us in front of the captain's door, which was open, and by\n",
      "Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in\n",
      "the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",

      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to\n",
      "come along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft;\n",
      "but just then I heard a voice wail out and say:\n",

      "so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in\n",

      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      "This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",

      "for noth'n'. Jist because we stood on our _rights_--that's what for.\n",

      "boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from\n",
      "getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper\n",

      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been\n",
      "having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much\n",

      "more'n two hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the\n",

      "\n",

      "watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the\n",
      "rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering,\n",

      "\n",
      "So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as\n",
      "it happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must\n",
      "start in and \"'terpret\" it, because it was sent for a warning. He said\n",
      "the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good,\n",
      "but the current was another man that would get us away from him. The\n",
      "whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then, and if\n",
      "we didn't try hard to make out to understand them they'd just take us\n",
      "into bad luck, 'stead of keeping us out of it. The lot of towheads was\n",
      "troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all\n",
      "kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our business and didn't talk\n",
      "back and aggravate them, we would pull through and get out of the fog\n",

      "\n",
      "Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash\n",
      "again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he\n",
      "couldn't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place\n",
      "again right away. But when he did get the thing straightened around he\n",

      "Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there\n",

      "We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind\n",
      "a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She\n",
      "had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as\n",
      "thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and\n",
      "an open camp-fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end.\n",
      "There was a power of style about her. It _amounted_ to something being\n",
      "a raftsman on such a craft as that.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and\n",
      "got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\n",
      "both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We\n",
      "talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got\n",
      "to it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't\n",
      "but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them\n",
      "lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if\n",
      "the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said\n",
      "maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming\n",
      "into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the\n",
      "question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light\n",
      "showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a\n",
      "trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know\n",
      "how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a\n",
      "smoke on it and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and\n",
      "not pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it,\n",
      "because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it\n",
      "he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every\n",
      "little while he jumps up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dah she is?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning-bugs; so he set\n",
      "down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him\n",
      "all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can\n",
      "tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him,\n",
      "because I begun to get it through my head that he _was_ most free--and\n",
      "who was to blame for it? Why, _me_. I couldn't get that out of my\n",
      "conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't\n",
      "rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to\n",
      "me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and\n",
      "it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out\n",
      "to myself that _I_ warn't to blame, because _I_ didn't run Jim off\n",
      "from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says,\n",
      "every time, \"But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you\n",
      "could 'a' paddled ashore and told somebody.\" That was so--I couldn't\n",
      "get around that no way. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to\n",
      "me, \"What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her\n",
      "nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word?\n",
      "What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so\n",
      "mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you\n",
      "your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how.\n",
      "_That's_ what she done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I\n",
      "fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was\n",
      "fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.\n",
      "Every time he danced around and says, \"Dah's Cairo!\" it went through\n",
      "me like a shot, and I thought if it _was_ Cairo I reckoned I would die\n",
      "of miserableness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was\n",
      "saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free state he\n",
      "would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he\n",
      "got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to\n",
      "where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two\n",
      "children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an\n",
      "Ab'litionist to go and steal them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk\n",
      "such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in\n",
      "him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the\n",
      "old saying, \"Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell.\" Thinks I,\n",
      "this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I\n",
      "had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and\n",
      "saying he would steal his children--children that belonged to a man I\n",
      "didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My\n",
      "conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I\n",
      "says to it, \"Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore\n",
      "at the first light and tell.\" I felt easy and happy and light as a\n",
      "feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out\n",
      "sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one\n",
      "showed. Jim sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de\n",
      "good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!\"\n",

      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom\n",
      "for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on\n",
      "accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it\n",
      "hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck;\n",
      "you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de _only_ fren' ole Jim's\n",
      "got now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says\n",
      "this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along\n",
      "slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I\n",
      "started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I\n",
      "tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't\n",
      "man enough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I\n",
      "just give up trying, and up and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's white.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish you would,\" says I, \"because it's pap that's there, and maybe\n",

      "stroke or two, I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pap 'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody\n",

      "\n",

      "over?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" says I, a-blubbering, \"I've told everybody before, and they\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Poor devil, there's something in that. We are right down sorry for\n",
      "you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the smallpox, you see. Look\n",
      "here, I'll tell you what to do. Don't you try to land by yourself, or\n",
      "you'll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty\n",
      "miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river.\n",
      "It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell\n",
      "them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don't be a fool\n",
      "again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we're trying to do\n",
      "you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good\n",
      "boy. It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's\n",
      "only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to\n",
      "say he's in pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold\n",
      "piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Hold on, Parker,\" says the man, \"here's a twenty to put on the board\n",

      "nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat.\n",
      "Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd 'a'\n",

      "troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the\n",
      "wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I\n",
      "reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do\n",

      "\n",
      "I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he\n",

      "\n",
      "Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty\n",
      "dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat\n",
      "now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free\n",
      "states. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he\n",
      "wished we was already there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about\n",
      "hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles,\n",
      "and getting all ready to quit rafting.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away\n",

      "\n",
      "I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out\n",

      "off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and\n",
      "thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was\n",
      "going to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a\n",

      "furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and\n",

      "minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",

      "didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell\n",
      "overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could\n",
      "have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight\n",

      "\n",
      "I set it down, private, because somebody might want _me_ to spell it\n",

      "I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and\n",
      "had so much style. It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor\n",
      "a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the\n",
      "same as houses in town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign\n",
      "of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a\n",
      "big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept\n",
      "clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another\n",
      "brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they\n",
      "call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass\n",
      "dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the\n",
      "middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the\n",
      "bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it\n",
      "for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was\n",
      "beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these\n",
      "peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape,\n",
      "she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got\n",
      "tuckered out. They wouldn't took any money for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock,\n",
      "made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the\n",
      "parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;\n",
      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their\n",
      "mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through\n",
      "underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\n",
      "behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind\n",
      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches\n",
      "and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and\n",
      "prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see\n",
      "where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or\n",
      "whatever it was, underneath.\n",
      "\n",
      "This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and\n",
      "blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It\n",
      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books,\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I\n",
      "didn't read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another\n",
      "was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if\n",
      "a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn-book, and a lot of other\n",
      "books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound,\n",
      "too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and\n",

      "willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white\n",
      "handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said \"Shall\n",

      "hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there\n",
      "in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a\n",
      "handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand\n",
      "with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said \"I Shall Never\n",
      "Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"  There was one where a young lady\n",
      "was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her\n",
      "cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing-wax\n",
      "showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain\n",
      "to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said \"And Art\n",
      "Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\" These was all nice pictures, I\n",

      "Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all\n",
      "over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and\n",
      "that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow\n",
      "Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first\n",
      "aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he\n",
      "warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was\n",
      "very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign\n",
      "of red in it anywheres; he was clean-shaved every morning all over his\n",
      "thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind\n",
      "of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest\n",
      "kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking\n",
      "out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his\n",
      "hair was gray and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was\n",
      "long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a\n",
      "full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your\n",
      "eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass\n",
      "buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it.\n",
      "There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever\n",
      "loud. He was as kind as he could be--you could feel that, you know,\n",
      "and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to\n",
      "see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the\n",
      "lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to\n",
      "climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He\n",
      "didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners--everybody was\n",
      "always good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around,\n",
      "too; he was sunshine most always--I mean he made it seem like good\n",
      "weather. When he turned into a cloud-bank it was awful dark for half a\n",

      "a week.\n",

      "up out of their chairs and give them good day, and didn't set down\n",
      "again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard\n",
      "where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to\n",
      "him, and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom's and Bob's was\n",
      "mixed, and then they bowed and said, \"Our duty to you, sir, and\n",
      "madam\"; and _they_ bowed the least bit in the world and said thank\n",
      "you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful\n",
      "of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple-brandy in the\n",

      "junketings round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the\n",
      "woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly\n",

      "handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another clan of aristocracy around there--five or six\n",

      "heard Buck's gun go off at my ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from\n",
      "his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we\n",
      "was hid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run.\n",
      "The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the\n",

      "rode away the way he come--to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't\n",
      "see. We never stopped running till we got home. The old gentleman's\n",
      "eyes blazed a minute--'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged--then his face\n",
      "sort of smoothed down, and he says, kind of gentle:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" says Buck, \"a feud is this way: A man has a quarrel with\n",
      "another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\n",
      "then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\n",
      "_cousins_ chip in--and by and by everybody's killed off, and there\n",

      "\"Has this one been going on long, Buck?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I should _reckon!_ It started thirty year ago, or som'ers along\n",

      "it; and the suit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shot the\n",

      "by, they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we\n",
      "put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there--sometimes a\n",
      "mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes;\n",
      "soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly\n",
      "always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young\n",
      "cottonwoods and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out\n",
      "the lines. Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to\n",
      "freshen up and cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where\n",
      "the water was about knee-deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a\n",
      "sound anywheres--perfectly still--just like the whole world was\n",
      "asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first\n",
      "thing to see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull\n",
      "line--that was the woods on t'other side; you couldn't make nothing\n",
      "else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more paleness spreading\n",
      "around; then the river softened up away off, and warn't black any\n",
      "more, but gray; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so\n",
      "far away--trading-scows, and such things; and long black\n",
      "streaks--rafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled-up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of\n",
      "the streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks\n",
      "on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl\n",
      "up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you\n",
      "make out a log cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on\n",
      "t'other side of the river, being a wood-yard, likely, and piled by\n",
      "them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice\n",
      "breeze springs up, and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and\n",
      "fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but\n",
      "sometimes not that way, because they've left dead fish laying around,\n",
      "gars and such, and they do get pretty rank; and next you've got the\n",
      "full day, and everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just\n",
      "going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we would\n",
      "watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by\n",
      "and by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what done\n",
      "it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off\n",
      "towards the other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only\n",
      "whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour\n",
      "there wouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see--just solid\n",
      "lonesomeness. Next you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and\n",
      "maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they're most always doing it on\n",
      "a raft; you'd see the ax flash and come down--you don't hear nothing;\n",
      "you see that ax go up again, and by the time it's above the man's head\n",
      "then you hear the _k'chunk!_--it had took all that time to come over\n",
      "the water. So we would put in the day, lazying around, listening to\n",
      "the stillness. Once there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things\n",
      "that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over\n",
      "them. A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and\n",
      "cussing and laughing--heard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of\n",
      "them; it made you feel crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that\n",

      "talked about all kinds of things--we was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let us--the new clothes Buck's folks\n",

      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",

      "maybe a spark--which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on\n",
      "the water you could see a spark or two--on a raft or a scow, you know;\n",
      "and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of\n",
      "them crafts. It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there,\n",
      "all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up\n",
      "at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just\n",
      "happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I\n",
      "judged it would have took too long to _make_ so many. Jim said the\n",
      "moon could 'a' _laid_ them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I\n",
      "didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as\n",
      "many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that\n",
      "fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled\n",
      "and was hove out of the nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in\n",
      "the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up\n",
      "out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look\n",
      "awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink\n",
      "out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by\n",
      "and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and\n",

      "you couldn't tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",

      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",

      "one-horse place on the river forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was\n",
      "pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\n",
      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn't\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other\n",

      "ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans\n",
      "on it. Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard\n",
      "corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under\n",
      "the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was\n",
      "only four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next\n",
      "day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always\n",

      "Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the\n",
      "heat-lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the\n",
      "leaves was beginning to shiver--it was going to be pretty ugly, it was\n",
      "easy to see that. So the duke and the king went to overhauling our\n",
      "wigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick--better\n",

      "was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't 'a' turned in anyway if\n",
      "I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that every day\n",
      "in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream\n",
      "along! And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the\n",
      "white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking\n",
      "dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind;\n",
      "then comes a _h-whack!_--bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum--and\n",

      "_rip_ comes another flash and another sock-dolager. The waves most\n",
      "washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and\n",
      "didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning\n",

      "do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a\n",
      "sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most\n",

      "\n",
      "I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\n",

      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side\n",
      "of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the\n",
      "front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and\n",
      "shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he\n",
      "would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around\n",
      "this way and that, shouting, \"It's the brazen serpent in the\n",
      "wilderness! Look upon it and live!\" And people would shout out,\n",
      "\"Glory!--A-a-_men_!\" And so he went on, and the people groaning and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_amen!_)\n",

      "mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung\n",

      "Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him\n",

      "the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He\n",
      "told them he was a pirate--been a pirate for thirty years out in the\n",
      "Indian Ocean--and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in\n",
      "a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\n",
      "goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat\n",
      "without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing\n",
      "that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy\n",
      "for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to\n",
      "start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in\n",
      "the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path;\n",
      "for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all\n",
      "pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time\n",
      "to get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time\n",
      "he convinced a pirate he would say to him, \"Don't you thank me, don't\n",
      "you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville\n",
      "camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that\n",
      "dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody\n",
      "sings out, \"Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!\" Well,\n",
      "a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, \"Let\n",
      "_him_ pass the hat around!\" Then everybody said it, the preacher too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the king went all through the crowd with his hat, swabbing his\n",
      "eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for\n",
      "being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little\n",
      "while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their\n",
      "cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to\n",
      "remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and\n",
      "kissed as many as five or six times--and he was invited to stay a\n",
      "week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said\n",
      "they'd think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of\n",
      "the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in a sweat\n",
      "to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\n",
      "collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had\n",
      "fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\n",
      "wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said, take\n",
      "it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the\n",
      "missionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't\n",

      "The duke was thinking _he'd_ been doing pretty well till the king\n",
      "come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He\n",
      "had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\n",
      "printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars. And he\n",
      "had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which\n",
      "he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in\n",
      "advance--so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a\n",
      "year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on\n",
      "condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in\n",
      "cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the\n",
      "concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and\n",
      "was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry,\n",
      "which he made, himself, out of his own head--three verses--kind of\n",
      "sweet and saddish--the name of it was, \"Yes, crush, cold world, this\n",
      "breaking heart\"--and he left that all set up and ready to print in the\n",
      "paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars\n",
      "and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged\n",
      "for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with\n",
      "a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and \"$200 reward\" under it. The\n",
      "reading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot. It said he\n",
      "run away from St. Jacques's plantation, forty mile below New Orleans,\n",
      "last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and\n",

      "\"Now,\" says the duke, \"after to-night we can run in the daytime if we\n",

      "we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a\n",
      "steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and\n",

      "still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of us\n",

      "\n",
      "Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\n",
      "stirred, and there warn't no more laughing. Boggs rode off\n",
      "blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street;\n",
      "and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still\n",
      "keeping it up. Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to\n",
      "shut up, but he wouldn't; they told him it would be one o'clock in\n",
      "about fifteen minutes, and so he _must_ go home--he must go right\n",
      "away. But it didn't do no good. He cussed away with all his might, and\n",
      "throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away\n",
      "he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying.\n",
      "Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him\n",
      "off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it\n",
      "warn't no use--up the street he would tear again, and give Sherburn\n",
      "another cussing. By and by somebody says:\n",

      "a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him\n",
      "along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back\n",
      "any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody sings out:\n",

      "\"Boggs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel\n",

      "with the barrel tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a\n",
      "young girl coming on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men\n",
      "turned round to see who called him, and when they see the pistol the\n",
      "men jumped to one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and\n",
      "steady to a level--both barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his\n",
      "hands and says, \"O Lord, don't shoot!\" Bang! goes the first shot, and\n",
      "he staggers back, clawing at the air--bang! goes the second one, and\n",
      "he tumbles backwards onto the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms\n",
      "spread out. That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down\n",
      "she throws herself on her father, crying, and saying, \"Oh, he's killed\n",
      "him, he's killed him!\" The crowd closed up around them, and shouldered\n",
      "and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying to see, and\n",
      "people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting, \"Back,\n",
      "back! give him air, give him air!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol onto the ground, and turned\n",
      "around on his heels and walked off.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just\n",
      "the same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good\n",
      "place at the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They\n",
      "laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and\n",
      "opened another one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his\n",
      "shirt first, and I seen where one of the bullets went in. He made\n",
      "about a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he\n",
      "drawed in his breath, and letting it down again when he breathed it\n",
      "out--and after that he laid still; he was dead. Then they pulled his\n",
      "daughter away from him, screaming and crying, and took her off. She\n",
      "was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale\n",
      "and scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging\n",
      "and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but\n",
      "people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind\n",
      "them was saying all the time, \"Say, now, you've looked enough, you\n",
      "fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar all the\n",

      "from one place to t'other and watching everything he done, and bobbing\n",
      "their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting\n",
      "their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground\n",
      "with his cane; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn\n",
      "had stood, frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes, and\n",
      "sung out, \"Boggs!\" and then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and\n",

      "every window along the road was full of women's heads, and there was\n",

      "to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun\n",

      "and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next\n",

      "around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his\n",
      "life--and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He\n",

      "shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and\n",
      "dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that\n",
      "horse with his whip and made him fairly hum--and finally skipped off,\n",
      "and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody\n",
      "just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.\n",
      "\n",

      "Next day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out\n",
      "in the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river,\n",
      "and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them\n",
      "towns. Jim he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take\n",
      "but a few hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when\n",
      "he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when\n",
      "we left him all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened\n",
      "on to him all by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he\n",
      "was a runaway nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard\n",
      "to have to lay roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get\n",
      "around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He\n",
      "dressed Jim up in King Lear's outfit--it was a long curtain-calico\n",
      "gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his\n",
      "theater paint and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all\n",
      "over a dead, dull solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine\n",
      "days. Blamed if he warn't the horriblest-looking outrage I ever see.\n",
      "Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n",
      "\n",
      "_Sick Arab--but harmless when not out of his head._\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or\n",
      "five foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was a\n",
      "sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and\n",
      "trembling all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to\n",
      "make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around,\n",
      "he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl\n",
      "or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and\n",
      "leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the\n",
      "average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only\n",
      "look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",
      "so much money in it, but they judged it wouldn't be safe, because\n",
      "maybe the news might 'a' worked along down by this time. They couldn't\n",
      "hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he\n",
      "reckoned he'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he\n",
      "couldn't put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he\n",
      "allowed he would drop over to t'other village without any plan, but\n",
      "just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way--meaning the\n",
      "devil, I reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped\n",
      "last; and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to put mine on. I\n",
      "done it, of course. The king's duds was all black, and he did look\n",
      "real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change a body\n",
      "before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever\n",
      "was; but now, when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow\n",
      "and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say\n",
      "he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus\n",
      "himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle ready. There\n",
      "was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point, about\n",
      "three mile above the town--been there a couple of hours, taking on\n",
      "freight. Says the king:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St.\n",

      "\n",
      "I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride. I\n",
      "fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\n",
      "scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come\n",
      "to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log\n",
      "swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather;\n",
      "and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Adolphus\"--meaning me, I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap was\n",
      "mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such\n",
      "weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him\n",
      "he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning,\n",
      "and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up\n",
      "there. The young fellow says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr. Wilks, sure, and he\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, he don't miss any property by it, because he'll get that all\n",
      "right; but he's missed seeing his brother Peter die--which he mayn't\n",
      "mind, nobody can tell as to that--but his brother would 'a' give\n",
      "anything in this world to see _him_ before he died; never talked about\n",
      "nothing else all these three weeks; hadn't seen him since they was\n",
      "boys together--and hadn't ever seen his brother William at all--that's\n",
      "the deef and dumb one--William ain't more than thirty or thirty-five.\n",
      "Peter and George were the only ones that come out here; George was the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Did anybody send 'em word?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because Peter\n",
      "said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this\n",
      "time. You see, he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too young\n",
      "to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one; and\n",
      "so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and didn't\n",
      "seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted to see\n",
      "Harvey--and William, too, for that matter--because he was one of them\n",
      "kind that can't bear to make a will. He left a letter behind for\n",
      "Harvey, and said he'd told in it where his money was hid, and how he\n",
      "wanted the rest of the property divided up so George's g'yirls would\n",

      "\"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and they ain't\n",
      "going to let them come to no harm. There's Hobson, the Babtis'\n",
      "preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford,\n",
      "and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop\n",
      "there. When they're deep they won't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat\n",
      "will, but this is a St. Louis one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Was Peter Wilks well off?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, 'bout the middle of the day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go, one time or\n",
      "another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we're all\n",
      "right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to always say that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon\n",
      "she got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\n",
      "my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\n",
      "another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\n",
      "carpet-bags. And if he's gone over to t'other side, go over there and\n",
      "git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course. When I\n",
      "got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set down on a\n",
      "log, and the king told him everything, just like the young fellow had\n",
      "said it--every last word of it. And all the time he was a-doing it he\n",
      "tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\n",
      "a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but\n",
      "he really done it pretty good. Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and\n",
      "dumb person on the histrionic boards. So then they waited for a\n",
      "steamboat.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\n",
      "but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\n",
      "was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we went\n",
      "aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only\n",
      "wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a\n",
      "cussing, and said they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm. He\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on\n",
      "and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to\n",
      "the village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down\n",
      "when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\" they\n",
      "give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to\n",
      "say, \"What 'd I tell you?\" Then one of them says, kind of soft and\n",
      "gentle:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\n",
      "live yesterday evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went all to smash, and fell up\n",
      "against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\n",
      "back, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Alas, alas, our poor brother--gone, and we never got to see him; oh,\n",
      "it's too, too hard!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\n",
      "the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and\n",
      "bust out a-crying. If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds,\n",
      "that ever I struck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\n",
      "sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the\n",
      "hill for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king\n",
      "all about his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over\n",
      "again on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that\n",
      "dead tanner like they'd lost the twelve disciples. Well, if ever I\n",

      "all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls\n",
      "brisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more homely and\n",

      "I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn't\n",

      "and making no more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people\n",
      "around, he squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done\n",
      "it with nods, and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over\n",
      "against the wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I\n",

      "the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it\n",

      "wait--you couldn't hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and\n",

      "more outrageous all the time; and at last, when he had gone around two\n",

      "seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with a most\n",
      "amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead still, and the\n",
      "parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a minute or two\n",
      "here comes this undertaker's back and shoulders gliding along the wall\n",
      "again; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room, and\n",
      "then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands, and stretched his\n",
      "neck out towards the preacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a\n",
      "kind of a coarse whisper, \"_He had a rat!_\" Then he drooped down and\n",
      "glided along the wall again to his place. You could see it was a great\n",

      "And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with\n",
      "them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be\n",

      "open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was\n",
      "open and she'd been packing things in it--getting ready to go to\n",
      "England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and\n",
      "had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of\n",
      "course anybody would. I went in there and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and _I_\n",
      "can't--most always. Tell me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So she done it. And it was the niggers--I just expected it. She said\n",

      "didn't know _how_ she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the\n",
      "mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no\n",
      "more--and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't _ever_ going to see each other\n",
      "any more!\"\n",

      "_again_, say it _again!_\n",
      "\n",
      "I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close\n",

      "impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and\n",
      "eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to\n",
      "studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells\n",
      "the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many\n",
      "resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain;\n",
      "but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest\n",
      "if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_\n",
      "than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time\n",
      "or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing\n",

      "setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where\n",
      "you'll go to. Then I says:\n",

      "it. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of\n",

      "can stand the rest middling easy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal\n",
      "water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher\n",
      "all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first\n",
      "struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to\n",
      "where she flung herself onto the king's breast at the front door and\n",
      "he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The brute! Come, don't waste a minute--not a _second_--we'll have\n",

      "\"Oh,\" she says, \"what am I _thinking_ about!\" she says, and set right\n",
      "down again. \"Don't mind what I said--please don't--you _won't_, now,\n",

      "No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of\n",

      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It's _well_ for you to set\n",
      "there and blubber like a baby--it's fitten for you, after the way\n",
      "you've acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble\n",
      "everything--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own\n",
      "father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it\n",
      "saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.\n",
      "It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to _believe_\n",
      "that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you was so anxious to make\n",
      "up the deffisit--you wanted to get what money I'd got out of the\n",
      "'None-such' and one thing or another, and scoop it _all!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffersit; it warn't me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out of you!\" says the duke. \"And\n",
      "_now_ you see what you _got_ by it. They've got all their own money\n",
      "back, and all of _ourn_ but a shekel or two _besides_. G'long to bed,\n",
      "and don't you deffersit _me_ no more deffersits, long 's _you_ live!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for\n",
      "comfort, and before long the duke tackled _his_ bottle; and so in\n",
      "about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the\n",
      "tighter they got the lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each\n",
      "other's arms. They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king\n",
      "didn't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about\n",
      "hiding the money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of\n",
      "course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along\n",
      "down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a\n",
      "mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish\n",
      "moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It\n",
      "was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn\n",
      "and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and\n",
      "they begun to work the villages again.\n",
      "\n",
      "First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\n",
      "for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a\n",
      "dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a\n",
      "kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped\n",
      "in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at\n",
      "yellocution; but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up\n",
      "and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They\n",
      "tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling\n",
      "fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn't seem to have\n",
      "no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around\n",
      "the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying\n",
      "nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together\n",
      "in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a\n",
      "time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judged\n",
      "they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned\n",
      "it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to\n",
      "break into somebody's house or store, or was going into the\n",
      "counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty\n",
      "scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the\n",
      "world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we\n",
      "would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind.\n",
      "Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about\n",
      "two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and\n",
      "the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up\n",
      "to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the\n",
      "\"Royal Nonesuch\" there yet. (\"House to rob, you _mean_,\" says I to\n",
      "myself; \"and when you get through robbing it you'll come back here and\n",
      "wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft--and you'll have to\n",
      "take it out in wondering.\") And he said if he warn't back by midday\n",
      "the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and\n",
      "was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we\n",
      "couldn't seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little\n",
      "thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday\n",
      "come and no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance\n",
      "for _the_ chance on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the\n",
      "village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found\n",
      "him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of\n",
      "loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening\n",
      "with all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do\n",
      "nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and\n",
      "the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I\n",
      "lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the\n",
      "river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind\n",
      "that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I\n",
      "got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Set her loose, Jim; we're all right now!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was\n",
      "gone! I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and\n",
      "run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it\n",
      "warn't no use--old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn't\n",
      "help it. But I couldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the\n",
      "road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy\n",
      "walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and\n",
      "so, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whereabouts?\" says I.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Down to Silas Phelps's place, two mile below here. He's a runaway\n",
      "nigger, and they've got him. Was you looking for him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two\n",
      "ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to\n",
      "lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since;\n",
      "afeard to come out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" he says, \"you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got\n",
      "him. He run off f'm down South som'ers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a good job they got him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I _reckon!_ There's two hundred dollars dollars' reward on him.\n",
      "It's like picking up money out'n the road.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it is--and I could 'a' had it if I'd been big enough; I see him\n",
      "_first_. Who nailed him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him\n",
      "for forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.\n",
      "Think o' that, now! You bet _I'd_ wait, if it was seven year.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's me, every time,\" says I. \"But maybe his chance ain't worth no\n",
      "more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap. Maybe there's something\n",
      "ain't straight about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But it _is_, though--straight as a string. I see the handbill myself.\n",
      "It tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells\n",
      "the plantation he's frum, below Newr_leans_. No-sirree-_bob_, they\n",
      "ain't no trouble 'bout _that_ speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a\n",
      "chaw tobacker, won't ye?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in\n",
      "the wigwam to think. But I couldn't come to nothing. I thought till I\n",
      "wore my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble. After\n",
      "all this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels,\n",
      "here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined,\n",
      "because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that,\n",
      "and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,\n",
      "for forty dirty dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to\n",
      "be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd _got_ to be a\n",
      "slave, and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to\n",
      "tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two\n",
      "things: she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness\n",
      "for leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again;\n",
      "and if she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,\n",
      "and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and\n",
      "disgraced. And then think of _me!_ It would get all around that Huck\n",
      "Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see\n",
      "anybody from that town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his\n",
      "boots for shame. That's just the way: a person does a low-down thing,\n",
      "and then he don't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long\n",
      "as he can hide, it ain't no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The\n",
      "more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me,\n",
      "and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at\n",
      "last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of\n",
      "Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness\n",
      "was being watched all the time from up there in heaven, whilst I was\n",
      "stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn't ever done me no harm,\n",
      "and now was showing me there's One that's always on the lookout, and\n",
      "ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur\n",
      "and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared.  Well, I\n",
      "tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by\n",
      "saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much to blame; but\n",
      "something inside of me kept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you\n",
      "could 'a' gone to it; and if you'd 'a' done it they'd 'a' learnt you\n",
      "there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes\n",
      "to everlasting fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\n",
      "couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I\n",
      "kneeled down. But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they? It\n",
      "warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from _me_, neither. I\n",
      "knowed very well why they wouldn't come. It was because my heart\n",
      "warn't right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was\n",
      "playing double. I was letting _on_ to give up sin, but away inside of\n",
      "me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my\n",
      "mouth _say_ I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and\n",
      "write to that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in\n",
      "me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can't pray a lie--I\n",
      "found that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to\n",
      "do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the\n",
      "letter--and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I\n",
      "felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all\n",
      "gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited,\n",
      "and set down and wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\n",
      "Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\n",
      "reward if you send. HUCK FINN.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever\n",
      "felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it\n",
      "straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking\n",
      "how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being\n",
      "lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over\n",
      "our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the\n",
      "day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and\n",
      "we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I\n",
      "couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only\n",
      "the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead\n",
      "of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was\n",
      "when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the\n",
      "swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would\n",
      "always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of\n",
      "for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I\n",
      "saved him by telling the men we had smallpox aboard, and he was so\n",
      "grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the\n",
      "world, and the _only_ one he's got now; and then I happened to look\n",
      "around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things,\n",
      "and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and\n",
      "then says to myself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\"--and tore it up. It was awful\n",
      "thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said;\n",
      "and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing\n",
      "out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was\n",
      "in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And for a\n",
      "starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if\n",
      "I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long\n",
      "as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with\n",
      "my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept\n",
      "the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my\n",
      "breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and\n",
      "one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for\n",
      "shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my\n",
      "bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and\n",
      "loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I\n",
      "wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam-sawmill\n",
      "that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, \"Phelps's Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there\n",
      "from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved\n",
      "along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got\n",
      "there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the \"Royal\n",
      "Nonesuch--three-night performance--like that other time. They had the\n",
      "cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked\n",
      "astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo!_ Where'd _you_ come from?\" Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, \"Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was your idea for asking _me?_\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I\n",
      "went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and\n",
      "offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back\n",
      "to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to\n",
      "the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him\n",
      "to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run,\n",
      "and we after him. We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him\n",
      "all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till\n",
      "dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When\n",
      "I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into\n",
      "trouble and had to leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the\n",
      "only nigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strange country,\n",
      "and ain't got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my\n",
      "living'; so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But\n",
      "what _did_ become of the raft, then?--and Jim--poor Jim!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft. That old fool\n",
      "had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the\n",
      "doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every\n",
      "cent but what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last\n",
      "night and found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole\n",
      "our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?--the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had\n",
      "trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat\n",
      "broke, there warn't anything for it but to try the 'Royal Nonesuch'\n",
      "another shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.\n",
      "Where's that ten cents? Give it here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all\n",
      "the money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He\n",
      "never said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can he blow? Hain't he run off?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the\n",
      "money's gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Sold_ him?\" I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money. Where is he?--I want my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"No--not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws boxed; I\n",

      "laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk\n",
      "of old cold cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty\n",
      "long blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a\n",
      "bit, neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of\n",

      "There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\n",

      "\"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" says the old man, \"I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you\n",

      "On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was\n",
      "murdered, and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no\n",
      "more, and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all\n",
      "about our \"Royal Nonesuch\" rapscallions, and as much of the raft\n",
      "voyage as I had time to; and as we struck into the town and up through\n",
      "the middle of it--it was as much as half after eight then--here comes\n",
      "a raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and\n",
      "yelling, and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one\n",
      "side to let them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king\n",
      "and the duke astraddle of a rail--that is, I knowed it _was_ the king\n",
      "and the duke, though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't\n",
      "look like nothing in the world that was human--just looked like a\n",
      "couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see\n",
      "it; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I\n",
      "couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world. It\n",

      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see we was too late--couldn't do no good. We asked some stragglers\n",
      "about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\n",
      "innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\n",
      "middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal,\n",
      "and the house rose up and went for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\n",
      "before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though\n",
      "I hadn't done nothing. But that's always the way; it don't make no\n",
      "difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't\n",
      "got no sense, and just goes for him _anyway._  If I had a yaller dog\n",
      "that didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison\n",

      "\n",
      "When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down\n",
      "to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the\n",
      "yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn't\n",
      "make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything\n",
      "comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the\n",
      "front and the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted\n",
      "with--which was the north side--we found a square window-hole, up\n",
      "tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if\n",
      "we wrench off the board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" I says, \"how'll it do to saw him out, the way I done\n",
      "before I was murdered that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's more _like_,\" he says. \"It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\n",
      "and good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\n",
      "There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide. The door to it was\n",
      "at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle\n",
      "and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid\n",
      "with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell\n",
      "down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a\n",
      "match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no\n",
      "connection with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing\n",
      "in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a\n",
      "crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the\n",
      "staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.\n",
      "He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're all right. We'll _dig_ him out. It 'll take about a week!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only\n",
      "have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but\n",
      "that warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but\n",
      "he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half-way about\n",
      "three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time\n",
      "most busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but\n",
      "after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for\n",
      "luck, and this time he made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger\n",
      "cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed\n",
      "Jim--if it _was_ Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting\n",
      "through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was\n",
      "piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the\n",
      "others was leaving, the key come from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches\n",
      "off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",
      "So Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; _I_ ain't heard nobody say nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a\n",
      "half the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin,\n",
      "and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim\n",
      "awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him\n",
      "up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and\n",
      "called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for\n",
      "having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with\n",

      "showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all\n",
      "about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time\n",
      "there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would\n",
      "see he got away, _sure_. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set\n",
      "there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of\n",
      "questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two\n",
      "to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable\n",
      "and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom\n",

      "on. It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and\n",
      "other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on\n",
      "the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them;\n",
      "and we would put small things in uncle's coat pockets and he must\n",
      "steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put\n",
      "them in her apron pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they\n",
      "would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on\n",
      "the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he\n",
      "couldn't see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white\n",
      "folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he\n",
      "would do it all just as Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we\n",
      "would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our\n",
      "children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better\n",
      "and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it\n",
      "could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best\n",
      "time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a\n",
      "hand in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",
      "candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in\n",
      "his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could 'a'\n",
      "worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it\n",
      "was only just a piece of rock or something like that that's always\n",

      "but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\n",
      "couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on\n",
      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\n",
      "in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that\n",
      "lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and\n",
      "keeled over onto the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like\n",
      "he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's\n",
      "meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself\n",
      "and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other\n",

      "and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked\n",

      "went out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it ain't no use to send things by _him_ no more, he ain't\n",

      "the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in\n",
      "t'other, looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went\n",
      "a-mooning around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd\n",
      "been to them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking\n",
      "tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and\n",
      "dreamy towards the stairs, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it. I could\n",

      "mind--let it go. I reckon it wouldn't do no good.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "mighty nice old man. And always is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said\n",
      "we'd got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out\n",
      "he told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the\n",
      "spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\n",
      "counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\n",
      "them up my sleeve, and Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. I know better, I counted\n",
      "'m myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and _I_ can't make but nine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to\n",
      "count--anybody would.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!\" she says. \"Why, what\n",
      "in the world--plague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!\" and she looked huffy\n",
      "and bothered both. But Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You numskull, didn't you see me _count_ 'm?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know, but--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll count 'm again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\n",
      "Well, she _was_ in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was\n",
      "so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd\n",
      "start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three\n",
      "times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then\n",
      "she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked\n",
      "the cat galley-west; and she said cler out and let her have some\n",
      "peace, and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and\n",
      "dinner she'd skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her\n",
      "apron pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim\n",
      "got it all right, along with her shingle-nail, before noon. We was\n",
      "very well satisfied with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth\n",
      "twice the trouble it took, because he said _now_ she couldn't ever\n",
      "count them spoons twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn't\n",
      "believe she'd counted them right if she _did_; and said that after\n",
      "she'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged\n",
      "she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever\n",
      "count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\n",
      "she druther die first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it\n",
      "would blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and\n",
      "we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through,\n",
      "and we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out\n",
      "with the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust,\n",
      "and we couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But of\n",
      "course we thought of the right way at last--which was to cook the\n",
      "ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second night,\n",
      "and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together,\n",
      "and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could 'a' hung\n",
      "a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\n",
      "into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\n",
      "enough for forty pies if we'd 'a' wanted them, and plenty left over\n",
      "for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could 'a' had a whole\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't need it. All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\n",
      "so we throwed the rest away. We didn't cook none of the pies in the\n",
      "washpan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble\n",
      "brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it\n",
      "belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come\n",
      "over from England with William the Conqueror in the _Mayflower_ or one\n",
      "of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old\n",
      "pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any\n",
      "account, because they warn't, but on account of them being relicts,\n",
      "you know, and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but\n",
      "she failed on the first pies, because we didn't know how, but she come\n",
      "up smiling on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set\n",
      "her in the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough\n",
      "roof, and shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off\n",
      "five foot, with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen\n",
      "minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But\n",
      "the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of\n",
      "toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to\n",
      "business I don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and lay him in\n",
      "enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too. Nat didn't look\n",
      "when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the three tin\n",
      "plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim got\n",
      "everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into\n",
      "the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and\n",

      "got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all\n",
      "right again, but couldn't set down convenient. And so we went for the\n",

      "and left. But it didn't matter much, because they was still on the\n",
      "premises somewheres. So we judged we could get some of them again. No,\n",
      "there warn't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a\n",

      "places every now and then; and they generly landed in your plate, or\n",
      "down the back of your neck, and most of the time where you didn't want\n",

      "things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when\n",
      "they'd all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't like the\n",
      "spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him,\n",
      "and make it mighty warm for him. And he said that between the rats and\n",
      "the snakes and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him,\n",
      "skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively,\n",

      "one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats\n",
      "was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so\n",
      "he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having\n",
      "a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders\n",

      "couldn't make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he\n",
      "would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim\n",
      "must glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and\n",
      "listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around\n",
      "out there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and\n",
      "stooped down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and\n",
      "slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all\n",
      "right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a\n",
      "splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had\n",
      "to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he\n",
      "dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then\n",
      "there was a rush, and a _bang,_ _bang,_ _bang!_ and the bullets fairly\n",

      "\"Here they are! They've broke for the river! After 'em, boys, and turn\n",
      "loose the dogs!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore\n",
      "boots and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell. We was\n",
      "in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close onto us we\n",
      "dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\n",
      "them. They'd had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the\n",
      "robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and here they\n",
      "come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we\n",
      "stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it\n",
      "warn't nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only just\n",
      "said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering;\n",
      "and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was\n",
      "nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my\n",
      "canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the\n",
      "middle of the river, but didn't make no more noise than we was\n",
      "obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island\n",
      "where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each\n",
      "other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away the sounds got\n",
      "dim and died out. And when we stepped onto the raft I says:\n",

      "I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did\n",
      "say--so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a\n",
      "doctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to\n",
      "it and wouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft\n",
      "loose himself; but we wouldn't let him. Then he give us a piece of his\n",

      "you get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight\n",

      " |  Construct an ndarray that allows field access using attributes.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Arrays may have a data-types containing fields, analogous\n",
      " |  to columns in a spread sheet.  An example is ``[(x, int), (y, float)]``,\n",
      " |  where each entry in the array is a pair of ``(int, float)``.  Normally,\n",
      " |  these attributes are accessed using dictionary lookups such as ``arr['x']``\n",
      " |  and ``arr['y']``.  Record arrays allow the fields to be accessed as members\n",
      " |  of the array, using ``arr.x`` and ``arr.y``.\n",

      " |      Note that `formats` must be a list, not a tuple.\n",
